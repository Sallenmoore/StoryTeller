It was as though the land had forgotten the power that lay dormant beneath Iron Mountain, until the earth was split by the thunderous roars of ancient beasts. Fire and fury rained down on Coia, scorching villages, and turning cities to rubble. The dragons had returned after eons of slumber, and Coia was thrown into chaos. We had tried everything&mdash;warriors, heroes, even the gods themselves seemed to shrink before the might of the scourge. But seven years later, I, Meklen Armash, saw a glimmer of hope in the darkness. The dragons had a weakness, and I would exploit it.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 2: The Gathering at Ironhold</strong><br>Ironhold, once a city of towering pride, was now a desolate ruin, its walls still blackened by the fires of the dragon&rsquo;s wrath. It was here, among the crumbling stones and ash, that I gathered what remained of the Seastone Resistance. Tim, son of Scott, whose mind was sharper than any blade, and Lofitus Hearthmaster, whose strength could break stone, stood by my side. We spread our maps, fragile relics from before the Awakening, across battered tables. These maps charted the mountain&rsquo;s labyrinth of tunnels&mdash;paths few had survived, but none could forget. With grim determination, I revealed the secret: Iron Mountain&rsquo;s antimagic shield would falter for a few short hours. This was our moment.</p>\n<p>I spoke to the gathered warriors, my voice unyielding. "Tomorrow, we face the monsters that have haunted our nightmares for seven long years. This is our one chance. We will strike, and either we will return as saviors&mdash;or we will become legends of a lost cause."</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 3: The March to Iron Mountain</strong><br>As we marched, the shadow of Iron Mountain loomed larger, an unyielding sentinel against the sky. Our path was lined with Dragonkin, twisted creatures who had given themselves to the dragons&rsquo; will. They were no easy foes, but neither were we the same resistance that had once fought and failed. With Lofitus leading the charge and Tim laying cunning traps, we carved our way through the enemy. The ground was slick with blood and ash, but we pushed forward, every step bringing us closer to the heart of the mountain&mdash;and the heart of the battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 4: The Hour of Reckoning</strong><br>The hour had come. Inside the darkened halls of Iron Mountain, our four-hour window began. Magic crackled in the air as our mages unleashed their power, and the dragons responded with torrents of flame and fury. The heat was unbearable, the stench of burning stone and flesh overwhelming. But we pressed on, deeper and deeper into the mountain&rsquo;s core. It was there, in the belly of the beast, that I faced Tiamet. The Dragon God. But also, not Tiamet. I could feel a deception rooted in my mind, but could not see past it. I could feel the weight of history in that moment&mdash;this was not just a battle for Coia, but for the very soul of the land.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 5: The Battle with Tiamet</strong><br>The creature posing as Tiamet was a force beyond comprehension. Its five heads lashed out in every direction, each one capable of leveling mountains, each roar capable of splitting the sky. But I fought with everything I had&mdash;every ounce of strength, every lesson learned from our countless defeats. It wasn&rsquo;t just me; it was the entire Resistance, standing behind me in spirit. I parried, dodged, and struck with all the fury I had bottled up over seven years of war. The ground shook beneath our battle, but I refused to fall. Then, with a roar that matched the Dragon God\'s own, I delivered the final blow&mdash;sinking my blade deep into Tiamet&rsquo;s chest. Its colossal form crashed to the ground, shaking the very foundations of Iron Mountain.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 6: The Silence After the Storm</strong><br>When Tiamet fell, so too did the war. Victory was ours, but it came at a cost. The mountain, once a symbol of dragon supremacy, was now eerily silent. The magic that had once protected it still lingered, a potent reminder of the power that once dwelled there, but the dragons were gone. Coia was free at last. As we stood on the battlefield, breathing in the scorched air, I realized that this peace had been paid for in blood. The blood of my comrades, the blood of those who dared to fight.</p>\n<p>The Seastone Resistance, once a flickering hope, had become a beacon of victory. Our names would live on in the songs of bards, our stories whispered by those who had survived. We had done what so many thought impossible. Coia was safe. For now. But even in victory, I knew one thing: dragons are not so easily forgotten. And neither are we.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',

The great halls of Iron Mountain had fallen. Meklen Armash and his Seastone Resistance, those audacious mortals, had dared to challenge our might and slaughtered our ancient kin. But we were not broken. In the Sanctuary, we nursed our wounds, sharpened our hatred, and whispered of revenge. Our vengeance would be as patient as it was inevitable. We would make Coia tremble once more.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 2: A Deadly Hunt</strong><br>With rage burning hotter than our flames, three of us, survivors of Iron Mountain, spread our wings and flew toward the ruins of Ironhold, where the Resistance crawled among the remains like scavenging rats. We sought Meklen&mdash;his blood, his family, his legacy. When we descended upon a patrol of Resistance scouts, we cloaked ourselves in deceit, bending their weak wills with promises of mercy. How easily they surrendered their precious secrets. Meklen's whereabouts, hidden from mortal eyes, were now ours to claim. But one of us let slip a threat too soon, and the battlefield ignited with steel and fire. The Resistance fought valiantly, but their efforts were laughable. We crushed them, our talons dripping with their defeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 3: The Village of Secrets</strong><br>Armed with their precious information, we soared to Hertrewen Lake, where a humble village sheltered Meklen&rsquo;s family in secret. As we descended upon the town, panic spread like wildfire. We unleashed our fury, and the Resistance soldiers stationed there fell one by one beneath our claws and fiery breath. Amidst the charred rubble, we found Meklen&rsquo;s wife and son, trembling like prey caught in a predator's gaze. They were ours now&mdash;hostages for our growing power. With our new captives and a traitor&rsquo;s whispers guiding us, we turned our eyes toward Whisperwind, Meklen&rsquo;s hidden stronghold.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 4: Battle at Whisperwind</strong><br>The ambush was ready, the traps set, but they underestimated us. They always underestimate us. We descended upon Whisperwind like shadows blotting out the sun, calling out for Meklen to face us. But the coward stayed hidden. When words failed, we let our fury speak. The castle&rsquo;s walls groaned under our assault, soldiers died in droves, and yet, somehow, they persisted. In the heart of the battle, a trap was sprung&mdash;Meklen&rsquo;s final trick. Two of us were caught as the doors exploded in a storm of magic and stone. But something was wrong. Something <em>changed</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 5: The Bond of Wild Magic</strong><br>In the chaos, we felt it&mdash;the strange connection. Meklen, the fool, had tapped into the forbidden power of the Iron Mountain's antimagic window, binding his fate to one of our own. None of us knew it at the time. As we pressed deeper into the castle, battering down walls and slaughtering the Resistance, Tim, son of Scott, rose from the carnage. The human struck, delivering a fatal blow to our injured kin. The dragon&rsquo;s death echoed through the bond&mdash;Meklen collapsed, his lifeblood drained in an instant. The mighty leader of the Seastone Resistance, felled not by claw or fire, but by a twist of wild magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 6: Retreat and Retribution</strong><br>In that moment, the tides turned. The Resistance, bolstered by their unexpected victory, surged. We grabbed Meklen&rsquo;s lifeless body and fled, our roars shaking the heavens as we soared into the night. But we were not free yet. Tim, son of Scott, teleported to a parapet, his eyes burning with fury. He unleashed one final spell, and the blast struck true. Another of us fell, spiraling down to earth in a blaze of flame and death. Bloodied and broken, we retreated into the dark sky, the bodies of our fallen kin left behind as Coia once again slipped from our grasp.</p>\n<p>But this is not the end. The dragons will rise again. Our revenge will come, like the silent beating of wings in the night, and Coia will burn.</p>",

                    "session_report": '<p>After several days of rest and recooperation, the party is summoned to the Unchained&rsquo;s hidden camp, where the air hangs thick with&nbsp; tension. After traversing a labyrinth of makeshift tents and armed sentries, they arrived at Lan&rsquo;s modest yet guarded quarters. The camp itself lay nestled deep within a forest, canopies of dark green trees looming overhead and filtering the light into a dim, hazy glow. The scent of pine mingled with the earthy aroma of damp soil as they approached Lan, a tall figure with hawkish eyes that always seemed to pierce through one&rsquo;s very soul.</p>\n<p>"An item must be retrieved," Lan announced, her voice as sharp as the keenest blade. "The patron who asks for this favor is elderly, and... well, there may be more to this mission than meets the eye, Igan," she added, allowing a rare hint of a smile to curl at the corner of her lips, "this may concern your past."</p>\n<p>A ripple of uncertainty washed over the group. The item in question was known as "The Finger of Keajor," and its location: a place called "The Weaver\'s Den." Even the name elicited shudders from those in the camp who had heard tales of its horrors. Before the party departed, they lingered, eavesdropping on the hushed conversations of the Unchained around a campfire.</p>\n<p>"I heard he was mad," whispered one grizzled veteran, his eyes darting about nervously. "Experimented on people, creating abominations."</p>\n<p>"No," countered a younger, wide-eyed woman. "She. It was a <em>she</em>, and I heard she was desperate to save her child... or husband, maybe. Those experiments were her last hope."</p>\n<p>A third voice chimed in, somberly, "Well, no one&rsquo;s heard anything from that place in months. It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s simply... died."</p>\n<p>The party exchanged uneasy glances, absorbing every rumor as they readied themselves for the trek. Their journey took them upriver, the waterway winding through craggy hills and dense forest.</p>\n<p>As they traveled, the river\'s gentle murmur turned into a shallow trickle, forcing them to abandon their ship. The air grew colder, and the atmosphere more foreboding, as they trekked through thickening woods until at last, the grim silhouette of the Weaver&rsquo;s Den rose before them.</p>\n<p>At the gates of this forsaken place, they were greeted by an apparition: a boy, thin and ragged, whose ghostly visage flickered in the pale moonlight. His eyes were hollow, cheeks sunken as though starved for life itself. He whispered a tale that chilled the party to their bones. "Viremon," he rasped, his voice carrying the agony of ages. "I was but a boy when my family sold me to Ursula... to survive the dragon&rsquo;s wrath." His form shuddered as he recounted his fate, standing as a silent testament to the darkness that lurked within the Weaver\'s Den.</p>\n<p>Bracing themselves, the party ventured inside. The hallways of the Den were dimly lit by sputtering torches, casting long, eerie shadows on the walls lined with ancient tomes and peculiar artifacts. It wasn&rsquo;t long before they stumbled upon a grim sight: the remains of a circle of mages, sprawled across the floor of a central chamber. The air was thick with the scent of decay, and splashes of dark, dried blood marred the room&rsquo;s once elegant tiles. It was clear a great battle had been waged here, an attempt by the mages to seal away something they could not destroy.</p>\n<p>As the party sifted through the scene, piecing together the grim tableau, they realized that these mages had stood against Ursula herself. Exploring deeper, they discovered a hidden passage leading to a prison below the Den. The stench of rot and despair hit them like a wave as they descended into the darkness. The cells were filled with Ursula&rsquo;s former subjects&mdash;her experiments. Some lay lifeless, their forms twisted into unnatural shapes; others sat rocking in the corners, eyes glazed over, lost to madness. A few, however, remained coherent. One stepped forward, eyes blazing with a glimmer of hope.</p>\n<p>"Brother," he croaked, his voice rough as gravel. "Help me." His name was Grisnag, a \'True\' Duergar with skin as stony as the caverns he hailed from. He spoke of his capture, his enslavement to the dark experiments of Ursula. "I was sent after you, into the sunlight," he revealed to Borin. "Captured by pirates... brought here. I was... easily replaced." His words resonated with the group, a chilling reminder of the cruelty and expendability imposed upon his kin.</p>\n<p>After helping him escape the Den, the continued navigating the grim labyrinth of the Weaver&rsquo;s Den and fighting off Ursula&rsquo;s lingering constructs. Cornered by her own disciples, Ursula had made a desperate bid for escape, attempting to transform into stone to evade their wrath. Yet, her plan had faltered as a dying mage, with his last breath, cast a dispelling incantation. When the party finally laid their eyes upon the coveted item&mdash;the <em>Finger of Keajor,</em> they found her too&mdash;half-turned to stone, her form grotesque and incomplete, yet still alive in a twisted mockery of life: a lich encrusted with jagged stone. Her presence radiated a chaotic energy, sending shivers down their spines as they battled her, evntually victorious. Grabbing the finger, they carefully packed it away for the journey back to the Unchained camp.</p>\n<p>Upon their return, they found the camp abuzz with tension and whispers. Seraphina, a high-ranking member of the Unchained, awaited them with a solemn expression. She approached Igan, the shadows of the trees casting long lines across her face, and spoke softly. "The finger can sever an individual\'s connection to wild magic," she explained. "A conduit of chaos, it disrupts order and cannot rebuild what is lost. You must decide if you will turn it over, and in so doing, sever your the opportunity to control your power."</p>\n<p>As Igan wrestled with this choice, Lan whispered in the ear of a grizzled veteran of the Unchained, who then stepped forward to speak with Grimgar. "I apologize for the deception," he began, his voice steady. "Rollo told us of you. I&rsquo;d like you to join us, to prepare for what&rsquo;s coming. There\'s no gold, no glory... only a world changed, hopefully for the better. Will you join us in the battle that looms on the horizon?"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another figure approached Tiammen. "I am sorry," the messenger began, his eyes downcast. "A dragon came in the night and left Hearthaven in ruins. Your family... some escaped, but your father... he perished in the attack. It seems the dragon had been searching for them for some time, guided to their location by treachery."</p>\n<p>The rest of the party sensed that their fates, too, hung in the balance. From the shadows emerged Redevus, his eyes gleaming with unsettling knowledge. For the first time, they noticed a short staff strapped to his back, its craftsmanship unmistakably that of the <em>Rod of Rulership</em>. Around his neck hung the <em>Amulet of the Planes</em>&mdash;a gem inset into delicate metalwork that they had seen before in a broken state.</p>\n<p>"Tell me your real names," Redevus demanded, his voice cutting through the air like a blade. His words hinted at knowledge that made the hairs on their necks stand on end. "Artifacts, when powerful enough, act as markers in time. Under the right conditions, they can pull you back to their moment of creation." His gaze grew sharper. "Do you remember? Portals, created by arrogant fools... they should be destroyed." He shot a glance at Borin, who stiffened under the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>"I need to work immediately," Redevus concluded, turning his back to the party. "Rest, eat, drink. Tomorrow morning, you will return home, but be warned: you do not return to safety." With those cryptic words, he vanished into the forest, leaving the party to ponder the weight of their choices and the uncertainties of what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>The fire crackled as they settled into their places for the night, each reflecting on the choices made and those yet to come. The <em>Finger of Keajor</em> lay wrapped in cloth beside Igan, glowing faintly with a power both tempting and terrifying. They would soon face not just the unknown, but the truth of themselves.</p>',

                    "session_report": '<p>The party, in their valorous triumph, now found themselves standing on the shores of the cursed island, the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> clutched firmly in Arcon\'s hands. The air was thick with anticipation, heavy with the scent of salt and lingering dread. Yet, a hint of hope sparkled on the horizon. With a resolute glance to his companions, Arcon stepped forward, his boots crunching against the jagged pebbles, and crossed the threshold of the island&rsquo;s ancient, magical barrier.</p>\n<p>As Arcon&rsquo;s foot left the sands of the island, the book cradled against his chest, an ominous shift swept across the landscape. The demons, previously lurking in the shadows of the island&rsquo;s twisted forests, let out a collective, otherworldly shriek. Their infernal forms flickered violently, tongues of flame licking at their monstrous hides. One by one, the creatures burst into flames, fiery pillars erupting into the darkening sky. The stench of brimstone filled the air as their charred remains crumbled into ash, their essence banished back to the hellish plane from whence they came.</p>\n<p>For a heartbeat, an eerie silence settled over the shore, broken only by the rhythmic crashing of the waves. It was then that a figure materialized out of the mist as if conjured by some unseen hand. He was short, swathed in an elegant cloak that fluttered in the sea breeze, his features sharp and hawkish. His eyes gleamed with an unsettling mix of mirth and wisdom as he approached the astonished group.</p>\n<p>"Ah, I see you have had quite the adventure," he remarked with a voice smooth as velvet. "Permit me to introduce myself. I am Redevus, a humble friend of Rollo and a supporter of the Unchained&rsquo;s noble endeavors."</p>\n<p>The party exchanged glances, suspicion and curiosity mingling on their faces. Redevus seemed almost out of place amidst the desolation of the island, his presence exuding an unearthly calm. He gestured with a gloved hand toward the sea, and the party\'s eyes followed. There, bobbing gently upon the waves, a sleek ship sat anchored a short distance offshore. It had not been there moments before, or so they thought.</p>\n<p>"I offer you the use of my boat," Redevus continued with a gracious incline of his head. "Consider it a token of goodwill. It should serve you well on your journey."</p>\n<p>Borin, ever the pragmatist, crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "And how do you plan to leave the island?" he inquired, his tone skeptical.</p>\n<p>At this, Redevus laughed&mdash;a rich, melodious sound that carried on the wind like a haunting melody. Without further explanation, he turned his back to the party and sauntered towards the dense underbrush. With each step, his form seemed to blur and fade until he was nothing more than a wisp in the twilight shadows.</p>\n<p>A heavy silence settled over the group as they pondered the mysterious figure&rsquo;s words. Still, with no other clear option, they boarded the boat, hoisting the sails to catch the brisk sea breeze. The ship cut through the waters, the waves crashing against its hull.</p>\n<p>However, the tranquility of their escape was short-lived. On the horizon, the outline of a ragged, blackened ship emerged, drawing ever closer. The skull and crossbones emblazoned upon its tattered sails left little doubt&mdash;it was a pirate vessel. A grim determination seized the party as the pirate ship bore down upon them, its deck bristling with cutlass-wielding rogues.</p>\n<p>Battle erupted in a whirlwind of steel and sorcery. Rooster let loose a barrage of arrows, each one finding its mark with deadly precision. Igan conjured a storm of magical energy, sending the pirates scrambling in chaos. Borin and Arcon clashed with the enemy in fierce melee, their blades flashing in the moonlight as they cut through the swarming attackers. The skirmish was short but brutal; the pirates, clearly no match for the seasoned adventurers, were dispatched with ruthless efficiency.</p>\n<p>With the pirates defeated, the party stood on the deck of their new prize&mdash;a pirate ship now theirs to command. They wasted no time searching the vessel, gathering supplies and seizing anything of value. The pirates had been bringing \'cargo\', human slaves, to someone they named in a note as \'Ursula\'. As they sailed onward, the thrill of victory tingled in the air, mingling with the salt spray of the sea.</p>\n<p>Now, with the wind filling their sails and the pirate ship trailing behind them, the adventurers set their sights on the horizon. There was business yet to attend to, mysteries still to unravel. The summons for Borin, cryptic and intriguing, awaited them at the Unchained camp. And so, they steered their course toward the camp, the evening sun casting a golden path upon the waves, guiding them toward the next chapter of their ever-twisting tale.</p>',

In exchange for our help destroying the protective barrier that trapped him and his demonic minions on the island, he promised riches beyond our wildest dreams. His end of the bargain? Once freed, he and the demons would return to their realm&mdash;<em>after</em> he "took care of one little thing" that he ominously refused to disclose. While tempting, none of us were eager to strike a quick bargain with a creature of his ilk. We requested an hour to consider his offer, which he granted with a toothy grin.</p>\n<p>Retreating to the protective chamber, we walked back across the rickety bridge when a figure loomed on the far side, clad in obsidian-black armor. The air seemed to grow colder at his presence, and his voice carried the weight of unspeakable cruelties. "I am the Master of Cruelties," he declared, revealing himself as Orcus\' right-hand enforcer.</p>\n<p>He offered a deal of his own, speaking in a voice that dripped with malice. "The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> contains Orcus\' true name, which, when spoken to him, will destroy him. It lies beneath the brackish pool in a shipwreck guarded by merfolk. Only a creature of evil can wield it, but whoever possesses the book can leave the island." His proposition seemed more promising, as we believed we might outwit him once Orcus was out of the picture. We nodded in agreement, but kept our expressions guarded.</p>\n<p><strong>The Red Room\'s Secret</strong></p>\n<p>With our new objective in mind, we ventured back to the red-glowing chamber. As we entered the crimson haze, a new voice, feminine and ethereal, whispered to us: "Travelers, you must help me." Realizing it was the voice of the mage Ariel, the very one who had sealed this island\'s dark forces centuries ago, we listened as she implored us to take the book off the island. Doing so would not only break the curse but would instantly kill everything still lingering on the island and send the demons back to their realm. As a show of her goodwill, she restored Borin and Harding to our group, their forms materializing from the red mist.</p>\n<p><strong>The Shipwreck and the Book</strong></p>\n<p>With the full party reunited, we downed potions of water-breathing and plunged into the pool\'s murky depths. We swam deeper until a hatch at the bottom opened to reveal a cavernous space where a shipwreck lay, ancient and cloaked in shadows. Its broken hull was partially obscured by a rock formation, beyond which the cavern seemed to open up into a vast underground lake.</p>\n<p>Moving cautiously toward the wreck, we were ambushed by four merfolk, their eyes gleaming with malice. The battle was chaotic, with swirling water and flashing blades. After dispatching them, we scoured the wreck but found only a few vials of purple liquid and a chainmail shirt. Refusing to leave empty-handed, we continued to explore the cavern until, at last, we stumbled upon crates hidden in the corner. Inside one of the crates, we found the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>&mdash;along with 600 gold pieces and a violet garnet worth 500 gold.</p>\n<p>Arcon Domine, being the only evil member of our group, gingerly took the book in his hands. As he flipped through its cursed pages, he felt a surge of dark power flood his senses. His eyes widened as he read aloud Orcus&rsquo; true name: "Nevik." We had what we needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Back to the Red Room</strong></p>\n<p>We swam back up to the red chamber, where the aura of the crystal healed our wounds. It was clear that the final showdown lay ahead, but first, we needed to eliminate Orcus if we had any hope of leaving this accursed island. We steeled ourselves, making our way toward Orcus\' lair, but on the bridge, the Master of Cruelties appeared once more. We told him that we had everything under control and would give him the book once Orcus was dead. "Wink-wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?" we added with false confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Showdown with Orcus</strong></p>\n<p>He escorted us to Orcus&rsquo; chamber, where Harding and Borin approached the demon lord, attempting to manipulate him into turning against his own lieutenant. Orcus, however, was no fool and saw through our ploy. A glint of anger crossed his monstrous face, and we had only a moment to react. Before he could act, Borin shouted, "Suck it, Nevik!" The words struck like a spell, and Orcus let out a piercing scream as his form began to disintegrate into a whirlwind of dust and shadow.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wrath of the Master</strong></p>\n<p>With Orcus defeated, we turned to leave, only to find the Master of Cruelties blocking our path. Thinking quickly, Igan conjured an illusion, making it seem as if the book had slipped out of Arcon\'s bag and was being carried off by a vrock. It bought us mere seconds, but the Master quickly realized our deception. His eyes blazed with fury, and his sword ignited with black flames. &ldquo;You dare try to play me?&rdquo; he snarled, raising his weapon as he prepared to exact his wrath upon us. The final battle had begun.</p>',

Finding himself in Borin's body, he landed among members of the Unchained, just about to receive their promised bags of platinum. However, before he could react, everything went dark.</p>\n<p><strong>The Torch-Bearing Battle</strong></p>\n<p>Back in the chamber, the creatures began to climb up from the pit. The party soon realized that these beings were fixated on extinguishing the room's torches.

Arcon, seeking power, stepped into the red light, hoping for some form of magical enhancement. Instead, he found himself instantly healed.

However, the ancient bridge couldn&rsquo;t hold his weight, and he plunged into the darkness to his death. Harding, attempting a rescue, also fell to her demise.

When the party tried to press him for more information about their situation, he simply brushed them off, explaining that a messenger would arrive later to provide answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Loretta's Arrival and the Island's Dark History</strong></p>\n<p>Later that day, Loretta arrived on a boat with dire news: the group had become the Silk Guard's most wanted, all thanks to farmer Greenfield's well-connected status. With her, Loretta brought two envelopes&mdash;one for Borin and one for Rooster. After reading the contents of his note, Borin grabbed the foldable boat and set off to collect their payment, promising to return the following day.</p>\n<p>As Rooster read his letter, Loretta delved into the island's history. She recounted how, 200 years ago, the town of Emberfield supported this island in a struggle against dark forces from another plane. A fortress was built on the island, serving as a battleground where troops rounded up the dark entities and mages sealed them within. The mages wielded a powerful artifact known as the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> to imprison these forces, sacrificing their own souls to cast the spell. The archmage who led the ritual had to give up her soul to maintain the barrier, which not only trapped the dark beings but also prevented them from returning to their plane. However, if these entities were slain on the island, they would respawn within a day, forever trapped in this realm. As an added protection, the island's magic ensured that no creature of evil alignment could leave.</p>\n<p>Arcon, doubtful of Loretta's tale, attempted to walk off the island to test the barrier's effectiveness. As soon as he stepped into the water, he was halted by an invisible force, proving her story true.</p>\n<p><strong>The Mission of the Order of The Tree</strong></p>\n<p>Rooster then shared the letter he received, revealing his connection to the <em>Order of The Tree</em>, an organization dedicated to eradicating evil. His instructions were clear: he was to vanquish the dark forces from the island. The party realized that they must find the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and end the island&rsquo;s curse. Given that Arcon couldn&rsquo;t leave until they completed the mission, they resolved to scour the island for the artifact and defeat the dark forces.</p>\n<p><strong>Venturing Beyond the Ward</strong></p>\n<p>The group planned their venture beyond the protective wards, intending to find the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and cancel the enchantment keeping the dark forces tethered. They traversed the island's outskirts but were forced to cut through the center due to dense forests on both sides.</p>\n<p>During their journey, they encountered a grotesque creature resembling a rotisserie chicken with toothed wings. Rooster spotted a large vrok perched on a distant structure. With a quick shot from his bow, he struck the vrok, provoking a second one to appear, and both creatures attacked. The party sprang into action, with Grimgar landing a solid blow on the chicken while the others focused on the vroks. Harding taunted the creatures viciously while Arcon swung his battleaxe. Igan, in a sudden fit of panic, grew gills and fled back toward the pond. Despite the chaos, Rooster and Tiammen managed to land decisive blows, slaying both vroks. From the corpses, Harding collected twelve talons worth 1 gold each.</p>\n<p><strong>Into the Fortress and Catacombs</strong></p>\n<p>The group continued onward, dispatching four more grotesque chickens with ease before coming across a large stone wall with a gate. After scouting the wall, Harding detected that the gate was cursed and warned that opening it would be tricky. Igan cast <em>Mage Hand</em>, successfully lifting the gate long enough for everyone to slip through into the abandoned fortress.</p>\n<p>Inside, they quickly encountered and dispatched a few demons before descending into the catacombs. Below, they found a network of tunnels densely packed with spiderwebs. Rooster burned away the webs with firebolts, clearing a path through the maze. Along the way, they dealt with several large spiders, looting their bodies for any useful items. Eventually, they found a staircase leading downward.</p>\n<p>Sneaking down, they emerged into a large chamber filled with levels and staircases, all illuminated by burning torches. Across the room lay a gate, and at the center, a foreboding pit. As they attempted to stealth their way across, Grimgar lost his balance and fell. The clanging of his plate armor reverberated throughout the chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Confronting the Darkness</strong></p>\n<p>The noise awakened something sinister. From the pit, several monstrous humanoid creatures began to crawl out. The party braced themselves. Whatever came next, it wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy...</p>",

Seeing the familiar faces and the tightening grip of their authority, it became clear to Tiammen that he had little choice but to surrender. A friend of his, Marcus, reassured Tiammen that the armor would be returned to the armory and that he wouldn't be blamed for theft. Trusting his old comrade, Tiammen was led quietly to a dungeon cell. Though a prisoner, he was left untouched and with all his belongings, a reminder that he still had allies within the Silk Guard.</p>\n<p><strong>What Do You Do with a Drunken Sailor?</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back at the Pit Inn, Harding took to entertaining the sparse crowd with song while Arcon knocked back drink after drink. Their revelry was interrupted by the arrival of Loretta, a halfling woman in the robes of the Order of Sea and Stone. Rushing to them, she urgently cast a Zone of Truth and warned them that they were in grave danger. Naturally, the duo&rsquo;s suspicions took precedence over common sense, and they began to question Loretta. Their hesitance gave enough time for several Silk guards to arrive, one of whom Arcon recognized as the man who had once imprisoned him.</p>\n<p>When ordered to surrender, Harding and Arcon instead chose chaos. Harding unleashed psychic damage and illusions to trick the guards, while Arcon swung wildly, his inebriation hindering his every move. Amidst the skirmish, Loretta escaped through a window. Eventually, Arcon managed to break open another window, and he and Harding fled into the night, following Loretta toward the Order of Sea and Stone with guards hot on their heels.</p>\n<p><strong>Mission Impossible</strong></p>\n<p>At the Order of Sea and Stone, Borin, Rooster, and Igan met Brother Aldric, who led them to Brother Andrei, the High Cleric of the Order. Andrei informed them that the Silk Guard had become aware of their activities, especially the incident at the Greenfield farm. Tiammen and Rollo had already been arrested, and an envoy had been dispatched to apprehend Harding and Arcon.</p>\n<p>Andrei explained, although the Order publicly maintained neutrality, they were secretly aiding the Unchained in their efforts against slavery. The group was given an urgent mission: sneak into the dungeons of the House of Silk and rescue Rollo before he could be interrogated. In exchange, they were promised 100 platinum each (except for Borin), though warned that if caught, the Order would disavow all knowledge of their actions.</p>\n<p>As they prepared for the mission, Loretta, Harding, and Arcon arrived, barely escaping the guards. After a hasty explanation of the plan, Harding reminded everyone that she was out of spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Jail Break</strong></p>\n<p>Entering the dungeon undetected, the party was fortunate to find both Tiammen and Rollo in the first set of cells they checked. After picking the locks and freeing their comrades, they decided to forego releasing other prisoners in favor of a quick escape. Upon spotting guards at the end of the hall, Rooster took them down with blunted arrows, deciding it was best not to kill everyone this time. Harding again reminded everyone she was out of spells.</p>\n<p>Navigating through the dungeon, Harding sent her raven ahead to scout. They managed to reach the room with the sewer entrance, dispatching a few rats along the way. Once in the sewers, confusion set in, and they soon found themselves facing a water elemental. Despite Harding&rsquo;s repeated reminders of her lack of spells, they quickly defeated the elemental. Retracing their steps, they finally found a ladder that led to an empty alley near the docks.</p>\n<p><strong>Escape to Stormwatch</strong></p>\n<p>With Harding and Igan pretending to be a couple out for a moonlit walk, they bribed the nearby guards, allowing the rest of the party to sneak onto the docks. There, they found Brother Aldric, who was waiting with a foldable boat. They unfolded the boat, climbed aboard, and set sail toward the island of Stonewatch.</p>\n<p>Arriving on the shore the next morning, the party was greeted by Brother Joseph, who granted them safe harbor with a document signed by Brother Andrei. Interestingly, the handwriting on the paper matched the contract for clearing the goblins that Rollo had.</p>\n<p>As the group settled in, Joseph inquired about their group name and leader. Igan promptly declared he would decide on the name soon. With that, they were led to rest, preparing for whatever lay ahead on Stonewatch.</p>",

                    "session_report": '<p><strong>Scene 1: The Grim Aftermath</strong><br>The morning light cast an eerie glow on the remnants of the goblin camp, where the Dragonbone Vanguard found themselves standing amidst the still bodies of those they had unknowingly massacred. The weight of their actions&mdash;the killing of unarmed goblin women and children&mdash;hung heavy in the air. Sheepishly, they decided to set up camp and take a long rest, trying to shake off the haunting reality of what they&rsquo;d done. As they settled in for the night, Harding rummaged through the spoils, identifying a few items that might be of use in the days ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 2: Return to Rueside&mdash;Tattered Morals and Tied Horses</strong><br>When morning came, the Vanguard, burdened by both their loot and their guilt, began the trek back to Rueside. Opting for caution, they returned the stolen horses to the very spot they&rsquo;d found them, though not without Arcon, ever the chaotic presence, taking a bite out of one of the poor beasts for reasons best known only to him.</p>\n<p>On the road, Borin wrestled with his dual identity&mdash;the cruel memory of his past as Szarden the slave conflicting with his present devotion to the Order of Sea and Stone, a brotherhood of knights who worship portals. Meanwhile, Meklen Tiammen revealed more of his own mysterious background as a soldier for the shadowy House of Silk. They soon came to a chilling realization: they weren&rsquo;t just confused&mdash;they had somehow traveled back in time, from the year 1248 CR to 310 CR. The implications were dizzying.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 3: A Clash at the Farmhouse</strong><br>Just outside Rueside, the quiet countryside was suddenly interrupted by the unmistakable sounds of a struggle. The Vanguard, against better judgment, chose to investigate. They stumbled upon a chaotic scene at a farmhouse, where a desperate farmer was fending off what he claimed were bandits. Borin, brimming with misplaced heroism, rushed in to ask the farmer what was happening. Faced with the ultimatum to help fight or leave, the Vanguard opted for their usual response&mdash;chaotic interference.</p>\n<p>Igan, ever the diplomat, attempted to diffuse the conflict with illusions and tricky maneuvers, while Tiammen took a more direct approach, firing arrows at anyone who seemed hostile. In the chaos, Borin, caught up in the wrong moment, unleashed a devastating fireball on a terrified slave. Arcon, predictably uninterested in the moral complexity of the situation, slipped inside the farmhouse to loot the food and beer. Harding, after initially observing from the sidelines, joined Tiammen in blasting the supposed bandits. Meanwhile, Grimgar and Rooster flanked the enemy with the farmer, subduing those who appeared to be invaders.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 4: The Truth Unveiled</strong><br>Amid the confusion, Igan finally managed to get a word in with one of the so-called bandits, a figure named Lan. What they said changed everything: "You\'re either with the Unchained or against us!" The truth hit the Vanguard like a hammer. These "bandits" weren&rsquo;t mere thieves&mdash;they were the Unchained, a group fighting to liberate slaves. The farmer wasn&rsquo;t the victim; he was the oppressor.</p>\n<p>Realizing their mistake, the Vanguard shifted their focus, quickly incapacitating the farmer and his guards. In the fray, the tiefling guard Hooly Appleton was killed, another casualty of their half-baked tactics. After the battle, Tiammen revived as many of the Unchained as he could, and they roused the farmer for a final interrogation. His tale was as expected&mdash;he viewed the slaves as nothing more than property, and the Unchained had come to take what he considered his.</p>\n<p>With little appetite for justice, Harding ended the farmer&rsquo;s life in cold blood, slitting his throat before anyone could object. The Vanguard, now neck-deep in consequences, hastily disposed of the bodies and set the farmhouse ablaze, erasing any evidence of their involvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 5: Loot and a Burning Farm</strong><br>As the flames devoured the farmhouse, the Vanguard looted whatever valuables they could find: 40 gold pieces, a scroll of "Speak with Animals," and a strange collection of night-vision goggles. Lan, the de facto leader of the Unchained, gathered the liberated slaves and left, but not before giving Grimgar a sending stone&mdash;a direct line of communication should they need help in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 6: Rueside&mdash;Uneasy Reunions and Future Promises</strong><br>Arriving at Rueside, the Vanguard found the city&rsquo;s gates more heavily guarded than before, tightened security due to recent horse thefts. Thankfully, Tiammen&rsquo;s Silk Guard uniform allowed them to pass through without question, and they kept their heads down as they made their way back to the Pit Inn.</p>\n<p>But Rollo, the man who had sent them on this perilous journey, was nowhere to be found. They tracked him down to the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, Mundi\'s Smithy, where a drunk and jubilant Rollo greeted Harding and Tiammen. He handed over their promised reward&mdash;200 gold each, plus a 50 gold tip. Slurring his words, Rollo revealed he had more work for them in Sluta, where he was headed with the topaz crystal they had risked so much to recover. Ever hungry for more coin, the Vanguard agreed to take on the new job, setting the stage for another chapter of reckless, bloody adventure.</p>',

                    "session_report": "<p><strong>Scene 1: Awakening in the Unknown</strong><br>The Dragonbone Vanguard stirred, groggy and disoriented, beneath an open sky in a desolate field. There was something wrong, a deep sense of dislocation clinging to their minds like a heavy fog. Szarden, the first to sit up, barely had time to register the strange scene before a shrieking goblin burst from the trees, gleaming in the sunlight, aimed at their hearts. Out of nowhere, a massive blue tiefling threw himself into the goblin&rsquo;s path. The spear plunged into his chest, and as he collapsed to the ground, life draining from his body, the Vanguard&rsquo;s minds were flooded with memories&mdash;memories not their own.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 2: The Bloodbath and the Enigma</strong><br>Instinct took over as the Vanguard sprung into action. Goblins lunged at them, but were quickly torn apart, dismembered in a whirlwind of sword and spell. As they stood amidst the bloodied field, weapons dripping, they exchanged bewildered glances. Who were they? And why did they have memories of lives that didn&rsquo;t belong to them? A hulking red dragonborn, who seemed disturbingly familiar, approached with a nonchalance that bordered on arrogance. \"Name&rsquo;s Meklen Tiammen. 'T,' if you like,\" he said, looting the goblins&rsquo; corpses with casual ease. \"You all were hired by Rollo to handle this infestation. Seems like your memories are all jumbled. Happens sometimes. Now help me find something special&mdash;a topaz, cylinder-shaped.\" It was unnerving how little T was unnerved by the sudden change in his companions.</p>\n<p>Memories flickered back into place like shattered glass re-assembling. Faces, names, roles. Nym thought of himself as Igan Dot now, a small dwarf known as Borin Stonehammer remembered being Szarden. Even Grimgar, the dour duergar, had the sudden realization he was once Zen. And Harding Quickstop, a halfling woman, had been Garus. The Vanguard was a patchwork of people and pasts, torn between lives lived and those lost. But the tiefling, the one who had died in front of them&mdash;must have been Polonius Pomp, one of the party's two Paladins. Arcon Domine, a hulking half-orc with an unexpectedly high voice who was previously known as the female human paladin Mythac, wept openly over the tiefling&rsquo;s lifeless body as the rest of the Vanguard turned away and followed T.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 3: The Encounter at The Pit Inn</strong><br>The Vanguard returned to Rollo, the man who had supposedly hired them. The Pit Inn was far from welcoming; the dimly lit interior reeked of stale ale and desperation. Rollo was waiting, and to their surprise, seemed shocked to see them. The infestation of goblins was supposed to be 30 miles away, not right outside the city. Under pressure, he admitted the real reason behind the mission: a client had tasked him with retrieving a topaz crystal hidden among the goblins. What purpose it served? He didn&rsquo;t know, nor did he care. The Vanguard, now half-curious and half-suspicious, took the job anyway. After all, what was one more mystery in a world full of forgotten memories?</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 4: The Road to the Goblin Camp</strong><br>With a vague destination marked on their map, the Vanguard set off toward the goblin camp, the wilderness swallowing them as the city of Rueside faded behind. Along the road, they came across four horses tied to a tree, conspicuously left alone in the forest. Harding, ever the opportunist, performed a daring acrobatic display to cut the horses loose, and the group mounted up&mdash;at least, those who trusted the animals did. The rest, stubborn or cautious, continued on foot. As night fell, the glow of the goblin campfire came into view, casting ominous shadows that flickered in the gloom.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 5: The Slaughter</strong><br>The Vanguard attacked the goblin camp with brutal efficiency. Borin&rsquo;s Thunderclap erupted in a deafening explosion inside the first hut, reducing the goblins within to little more than a wet splatter on the walls. The rest of the camp stirred in panic, goblins and wolves surging from the darkness. But the Vanguard were unstoppable, cutting down foes as they navigated the camp. The battle carried them to the river, where Igan's magic tied a rope to a tree on the other side, and the group tightroped across&mdash;except Harding, whose stumble forced her to climb after them.</p>\n<p>They pressed forward, unaware that the night&rsquo;s true horror was yet to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 6: The Price of the Crystal</strong><br>At the final campfire, Harding, disguised as a goblin, led a captured Igan up to the remaining guards. But the ruse quickly unraveled. Neither Harding nor Igan could speak goblin, and in a moment of chaotic confusion, Igan began floating ten feet off the ground&mdash;distracted by newfound powers that flashed light and darkness around him. The jig was up, and the Vanguard tore into their foes with unrelenting savagery.</p>\n<p>The battle ended in blood, but as they looted the camp, realization dawned: the goblins they had slain were unarmed, smaller than the others. Women. Children. It was a massacre. Amidst the bodies, they found their prize&mdash;the cylindrical topaz crystal.</p>\n<p>As the Vanguard headed back to The Pit Inn, bloodied but victorious, they consoled themselves. The mission was done, but the memories of that night, and the slaughter of innocents, would linger in their minds long after the taste of victory had faded.</p>",

Whenever the party reaches a key area (entering the Academy, or near a powerful undead foe), there is a chance one of these spirits will attempt to possess a party member.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mechanic:</strong><br>DM rolls a DC 10 Charisma save for a player. On a failure, a spirit possesses them, and the type of spirit determines how they act:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1-3: Malevolent Spirit:</strong> The possessed player immediately attacks the party, eyes glowing red as they are overtaken by rage.\n<ul>\n<li>DM controls player</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>3-6:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Frenzied Spirit</strong>. The player is overwhelmed by terror and fights recklessly, dealing extra damage but at a significant risk of harming their allies or themselves.\n<ul>\n<li>Player must attack closest creature during combat</li>\n<li>DM takes control of player during combat</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>7-8:</strong> <strong>Sinister Spirit:</strong> The spirit subtly undermines party actions, sowing discord through misinformation or small, seemingly accidental sabotage.\n<ul>\n<li>DM secretly sends actions to the player that they must perform</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>9-10:</strong> <strong>Mourning Spirit.</strong> The possessed player is wracked with grief, paralyzed with visions of their past failures, and unable to act for a short period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To Break Possession:</strong> The possessed player must fight a twisted version of themselves in the ethereal plane&mdash;a personal battle for control. If they win the fight, the PC cannot be possessed again for 24 hours. If they lose the fight, they are the undead thrall of Ariel permanently (PK). The rest of the party must decide whether to help or leave them to their internal struggle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Attack Consequence:</strong> Possessed PC's HP is the same as PC's when possesed.

The dense forest gives way to an open road, lined with scattered remnants of a hurried escape&mdash;abandoned carts, overturned crates, and shattered lanterns. Smoke rises in the distance, and the foreboding silence is occasionally broken by the groaning of undead. Emberfield is no longer the lively town they remember; the once-proud buildings now lie in shambles, overtaken by dark magic, and the Emberfield Academy looms like a grim specter, towering ominously in the distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>History</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Stonewatch Island and Ariel's Sealing</em>: Ariel sealed the demons on Stonewatch Island centuries ago, sacrificing her own life in the process to save Emberfield.</li>\n<li><em>The Party's Mission on Stonewatch</em>: The party released Ariel from her prison, believing they were freeing a noble hero.</li>\n<li><em>Ariel's Madness</em>: Years of torment twisted Ariel's mind, leading her to target Emberfield, raising the dead and binding them to her will.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encounter Name</strong>: Refugee Scout\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>: As the dense forest opens to an abandoned road, the party hears faint screams carried by the wind. Shapes move in the distance, quick and skittish, like shadows fleeing a predator.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting</strong>: On the outskirts of Emberfield, the party encounters a ragged figure emerging from behind a broken stone wall.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>: The scout&rsquo;s face is pale and gaunt, his clothes torn and stained with dirt and blood. His eyes are wide with fear, and his breathing is erratic, each exhale visible in the chill air. The acrid smell of smoke clings to his clothes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The scout, noticing the approaching party, stumbles towards them, seeking aid before collapsing from exhaustion.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactions</strong>: The scout is a former guard of Emberfield, desperate and terrified. He speaks of Ariel&rsquo;s wrath, the dead rising, and the hopelessness that now grips the town.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Dialogue Prompts</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>\"It&rsquo;s Ariel&hellip; she&rsquo;s raising the dead. The town&rsquo;s overrun&hellip; the defenses have fallen.\"</li>\n<li>\"They turned&hellip; all of them. At night, they came back, twisted, unnatural. There&rsquo;s no escape.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Approaches</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong>: Calm the scout to gather detailed information about Ariel and the current state of Emberfield.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 14 Persuasion Check.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: The scout shares a crude map of Emberfield, highlighting key safehouses and hidden paths.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The scout spreads word of the party's bravery, earning the trust of a few surviving townsfolk.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Aggression</strong>: Intimidate the scout into revealing what he knows.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 12 Intimidation Check.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: The scout reveals information, but withholds critical details out of fear.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The scout distrusts the party, potentially causing other refugees to avoid them or refuse help.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ignore</strong>: Leave the scout behind and proceed into Emberfield.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The party enters Emberfield without any knowledge of the safe zones or key locations, making navigation more difficult and dangerous.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encounter Name</strong>: Possessed Villager\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>: Moving deeper into Emberfield, the streets seem empty except for a few lone figures lurking in the shadows. One of them, appearing human, is huddled near a dilapidated building.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting</strong>: Near a collapsed building, the party spots a villager waving at them for help.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>: The villager looks terrified, her face streaked with dirt, and her hands shaking. Her eyes dart around nervously, and for a split second, an unnatural flicker crosses them&mdash;something dark and sinister. Her voice is frantic, cracking with desperation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The party approaches to assist the seemingly innocent villager.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactions</strong>: The villager is, in fact, possessed by a demonic spirit. She attempts to lure the party close enough for a surprise attack.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Dialogue Prompts</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>\"Please&hellip; help me. They&rsquo;re everywhere. I barely made it out!\"</li>\n<li><em>(Sudden shift in tone, her voice dropping lower)</em> \"You cannot stop her&hellip; fools.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Approaches</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight Check</strong>: Recognize the strange behavior and discern something is wrong.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 15 Insight Check. Success allows the party to realize something is off about the villager.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: If they realize and manage to exorcise the spirit, they gain a <strong>Charm of Protection vs Undead</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: If failed, the villager attacks, and any chance of rescuing her is lost.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Combat</strong>: Engage in direct combat with the possessed villager.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Fight against both the possessed villager and the demonic spirit within her.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Upon defeating her, she drops a <strong>Scroll of Lesser Restoration</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The battle attracts nearby undead, and the party must deal with reinforcements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Traps</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trap Name</strong>: Cursed Street\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>: The cobblestone path grows unnaturally cold beneath the party&rsquo;s feet, and frost begins to form over the stones. A strange, faintly glowing rune is visible beneath the dust.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting</strong>: The trap is a ward left behind by Ariel to deter intruders.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>: The air thickens, the temperature plummets, and a faint hum fills the air. A sickly-sweet scent wafts through the cold wind, and the stones beneath begin to vibrate as the ward activates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The party steps into the rune-marked area without caution or recognition.</li>\n<li><strong>Approaches</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Detect Magic</strong>: Sense the presence of a magical ward.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 13 Arcana Check.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: On success, the party avoids triggering the curse. On failure, a burst of necrotic energy deals 2d10 damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Disarm the Ward</strong>: Attempt to carefully disable the rune without activating it.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 15 Sleight of Hand Check.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: If successful, the rune is rendered inert. On failure, the ward activates, dealing damage and marking the party, making them easier for Ariel&rsquo;s forces to track.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Deliberately activate the ward and endure its effects.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Constitution Saving Throw DC 14.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Failure results in a level of exhaustion and 2d10 necrotic damage. Success means the party endures the effect without additional consequences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Aftermath of the Arrival</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consequences</strong>: As the party edges closer to the heart of Emberfield, the realization sinks in&mdash;they are not the saviors they thought themselves to be. The ruined town serves as a haunting reminder of their own mistakes. The few remaining villagers who have managed to survive in hiding are torn between hope and resentment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Next Scene Hook</strong>: As they navigate through the ruins, the&nbsp;<strong>Emberfield Academy of Arcane Arts</strong> looms in the distance, a tower of twisted stone and crumbling grandeur. At the top, flickers of unnatural light flash as Ariel weaves her dark magic. The party must decide whether to press on towards the Emberfield Academy, where Ariel is said to reside, or take time to help more survivors. Regardless of their choice, the path ahead leads them into the heart of darkness&mdash;a direct confrontation with Ariel in her twisted seat of power.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Lingering Memories</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>: The spirits of Emberfield's citizens are trapped in a cycle of their final moments, reliving the tragedy that befell the town. To break Ariel&rsquo;s hold, the party must travel to different key locations to relive and resolve the final moments of several key townsfolk, freeing them from Ariel's dark magic.<br><strong>Mechanic</strong>: The party must locate significant spirits across Emberfield and interact with them to relive their final memories. They must help these spirits resolve their unfinished business, often involving puzzles, moral choices, or combat. By doing so, the spirits will also provide valuable information that will aid in weakening Ariel's power.</p>\n<h3><strong>Magical Barrier Powered by Grief and Demonic Influence</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>: Ariel's magic, twisted and corrupted by her time on Stonewatch Island, now fuels an impenetrable barrier around the Emberfield Academy, now her lair. Using the dark arts she gleaned from the demons, she learned to create a web of suffering that she could tap into and manipulate, feeding on the sorrow of Emberfield&rsquo;s citizens. The more spirits trapped in their grief, the stronger the barrier becomes. The spirits are bound to their final moments of suffering, and their collective agony powers the dark shield, making the shield impenetrable and Ariel even stronger. To weaken Ariel&rsquo;s defenses, the party must travel through the town, locate significant spirits, and help them move beyond their tragic endings.</p>\n<p>The spirits&rsquo; grief is not only sustaining the barrier but actively feeding it. Each spirit represents a well of pain that Ariel has tapped into, using the demonic arts to corrupt their memories and make them relive their tragic final moments over and over again. Only by helping these spirits resolve their unfinished business can their suffering be lifted, slowly draining the power from the barrier until it can be shattered and Ariel weakened.</p>\n<h3><strong>Narrative Details for the Magical Barrier</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visual Representation</strong>: The barrier itself is a swirling mass of dark, crackling energy, shot through with streaks of crimson and shadowy tendrils. The faces of anguished spirits appear briefly within the barrier, screaming silently before fading back into the darkness.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Experience</strong>: As the party nears the Academy, the air grows thick with despair, like an invisible weight pressing on their chests. The cries of spirits seem to echo all around them, and the unnatural chill in the air gnaws at their resolve. The barrier pulses with every anguished wail, the sound twisting into a cacophony that chills the soul.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why the Party Cannot Proceed Until Spirits Are Freed</strong>:</p>\n<p>The barrier&rsquo;s strength is directly proportional to the despair of the spirits trapped in Ariel&rsquo;s twisted magic. While the party can attempt to brreak through the shield at any point, the difficulty drops exponentially as each sirit is freed&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each significant spirit that the party helps, the barrier becomes weaker, losing part of its crimson glow, and the screaming faces become less frequent.\n<ul>\n<li>Mechanically, the barrier has a hit point total 0f 1000 HP that decreases by 200 hp each time a spirit is freed.</li>\n<li>Ariel's power is also reduced each time a spirit is freed&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the party gets close tot he barrier, tendrils of dark energy lash out, pushing them back and dealing d20+20 necrotic damage for each remaining spirit.\n<ul>\n<li>The barrier can incapacitate, but not kill party members</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Barrier Collapse</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once all the spirits are freed, the barrier collapses in a burst of energy, its demonic influence dissipating into the air, allowing the party to access the Academy.\n<ul>\n<li>The party may also gain boons from the freed spirits&mdash;protective charms, blessings, or other aids to assist them in the final battle against Ariel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>The Eclipsed Alcazar - Elendrir Thornwhisper</strong></h3>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location, Situation</strong>:<br>The Eclipsed Alcazar, a once lavish palace known for its splendor, now lies in a state of abandonment.

The spirit of Elendrir Thornwhisper, a mage from the Emberfield Academy, is trapped here, endlessly reliving the final moments before his death.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting Description</strong>:<br>As the party enters the Alcazar, they are greeted by echoes of a bygone era. The luxurious ballrooms, once filled with music and laughter, are now silent and cold. Tattered tapestries, depicting images of grand feasts and celebrations, hang limply on the walls. The air carries a faint metallic scent, and the temperature drops with every step, as if the very life has been drained from the palace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>History</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Alcazar's Construction</strong>: Built three centuries ago by the eccentric merchant Orion II as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in Emberfield.</li>\n<li><strong>A Place of Magic and Intrigue</strong>: Known for its grandeur, it was also rumored to be a site of clandestine magical gatherings, rituals, and secret societies.</li>\n<li><strong>Elendrir Thornwhisper</strong>: A shy and talented mage of Emberfield Academy, Elendrir sought refuge in the Alcazar during Ariel's initial attack but was ultimately caught and bound by her magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encounter Name: Reliving Elendrir&rsquo;s Final Moments</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>:<br>As the party makes their way through the Alcazar&rsquo;s halls, they hear faint whispers echoing off the stone walls.

The room is dominated by a massive, cracked chandelier that sways gently, despite no breeze. Cobwebs hang like lace curtains across the walls, and the once gleaming floor is covered in dust.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The ballroom smells of mildew and faintly of something metallic, like blood. The temperature is unnaturally cold, and the flickering shadows seem to be alive, moving and twisting even without a source of light. The sound of whispers fills the air, a constant murmur just beyond comprehension.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>The encounter is triggered when the party approaches the center of the ballroom where a spectral figure kneels. The ghost of Elendrir Thornwhisper appears, bound to relive his final tragic moments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interactions</strong>:<br>Elendrir's spirit is visibly distraught.

The chandelier above creaks ominously.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The trap is an arcane glamour left by Ariel, which turns the ballroom floor into a dangerous magical hazard.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The floor glistens unnaturally in the dim light, and the chandelier above groans like a wounded creature. The reflections seem to twist and morph, turning into ghostly versions of the party members with hollow eyes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>Stepping into the center of the ballroom without dispelling the magic triggers the trap.

The door to the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, moving slowly with the wind, creaking with every shift.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The encounter takes place inside the spiraling staircase of the lighthouse, which is filled with mist. A dense fog clings to the air as the party climbs the stairs, each step echoing louder than it should in the eerie silence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The air smells damp and salty, mixed with something metallic and almost acrid. The purple light from above pulses, creating shifting shadows along the walls.

When the party arrives, they are greeted by a sight of devastation.&nbsp;<em>Hearthaven</em> lies in shambles. Buildings are charred and collapsed, and the once lively town square is littered with debris. The air smells of soot and destruction, and a heavy silence hangs over the village. Smoke from dying fires curls into the gray sky, painting a bleak picture of the aftermath of the dragon\'s attack.</p>\n<p>As the party moves through the town, they are met with the harsh stares of the townsfolk. Where once the <em>Meklen</em> family name was spoken with pride, now it is met with venom. The people blame <em>Meklen Tiammen\'s</em> lineage for the <em>Dead Wyrm\'s</em> wrath.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong></p>\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li><strong>Meklen\'s Mother</strong>:\n<ul data-spread="false">\n<li>Foreshadowing: The Meklen family home stands as a tragic monument to the destruction wrought by the <em>Dead Wyrm</em>. Its walls are charred, and the front door is barely hanging on its hinges, swinging gently with an agonizing creak. The air here is filled with a stinging mix of burnt wood and something faintly metallic&mdash;perhaps blood. As you enter, the floorboards groan under your weight. The room feels cold, devoid of any of the warmth of the family that once lived here. Dust motes swirl in the beams of light that manage to pierce through the holes in the roof, giving the entire scene an eerie stillness.</li>\n<li>Setting: The only surviving member of&nbsp;<em>Meklen\'s</em> family is his mother, <em>Elira Tiammen</em>. The party finds her in the ruins of their family home, sitting among the broken timbers and shattered memories. Her eyes are hollow with grief, but she still manages a faint smile when she sees her son\n<ul data-spread="false">\n<li><em>Elira\'s Words</em>: "Meklen... I thought I had lost you too." She looks at the ruins around her. "Our family... everything we built... gone. But you are still here, and that means there is hope."</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Angry Villagers</strong>\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li><em>Foreshadowing: </em>The town of Hearthaven is eerily silent as you enter. The usual hustle of townsfolk and the creak of cart wheels are replaced by the gentle whisper of wind through empty streets. The air smells of smoke and scorched wood, with an acrid tang that lingers, stinging your nostrils. The buildings around you are battered and broken, some with roofs collapsed, others with shattered windows that hang like jagged teeth in their frames. The dust from fallen debris coats your boots, each step echoing unnaturally in the hollow town.</li>\n<li><em>Setting</em>: The few remaining townsfolk you encounter watch you warily, their eyes sunken and tired. The atmosphere is tense, their voices carrying a mixture of fear and resentment. "If only the <em>Meklen</em> family hadn&rsquo;t angered that beast," one whispers, their breath visible in the cold air. There&rsquo;s a bitterness in the words, and you can almost taste it&mdash;sharp and acrid, like spoiled wine. The wind picks up, rustling loose sheets of metal and broken signs, underscoring the fragility of the town&rsquo;s mood.\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li><strong>Townsperson 1</strong>: A middle-aged farmer, his face lined with grief and anger, spits at the party\'s feet. "Look what your family has brought us, Tiammen. Maybe it\'s time the <em>Meklen</em> name ended."</li>\n<li><strong>Townsperson 2</strong>: An elderly woman, once a family friend, shakes her head. "We were proud of the <em>Meklen</em> name... but now? Perhaps it\'s better if there\'s no one left to bear it."</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Approach</em>:\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li>Peaceful Resolution: The party must succeed in Persuasion (DC 16) or Charisma (DC 15) checks to calm the villagers. Offering to help rebuild or promising protection might also earn goodwill.</li>\n<li>Combat Resolution: The party may need to deal with an aggressive mob using non-lethal combat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Loot/Rewards</em>:\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li>Peaceful: The villagers offer the party a Potion of Heroism and a bag of Reinforced Bolts (for crossbows).</li>\n<li>Combat: The party finds 20 gp scattered amongst the angry villagers, but they leave a fearful impression behind.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Rescued Survivors</strong>\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li><em>Foreshadowing: </em>A young boy peeks out from behind a pile of rubble, his face smudged with dirt. His eyes are wide, haunted, as he watches you. The smell of smoke still clings to his clothes, and his bare feet shuffle nervously in the dirt. When you crouch to talk to him, he flinches slightly, the fear almost palpable. His voice is thin and raspy, barely a whisper as he speaks of hiding while the dragon destroyed his home. The sun dips lower, casting long shadows, and the boy shivers, wrapping his thin arms around himself for warmth.</li>\n<li><em>Setting</em>: A few villagers are trapped under the collapsed remains of their home. They are panicked and exhausted.</li>\n<li><em>Approach</em>:\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li>Resolution: The party can make Strength (DC 14) or Athletics checks to clear the debris safely, rescuing the villagers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Loot/Rewards</em>:\n<ul data-spread="true">\n<li>Success: The survivors give the party a Scroll of Lesser Restoration as thanks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Journey to Whisperwind Fortress</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Setting: The Dense Forest and the Mountain Ascent</strong></p>\n<p>The party leaves <em>Hearthaven</em>, their resolve hardened by what they have seen. The journey to <em>Whisperwind Fortress</em> takes them through dense forest and up into the mountains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forest is draped in a thick morning fog, the kind that clings to your skin like a damp cloak. The air smells earthy and rich, a mix of decaying leaves and fresh pine needles, while the crunch of damp twigs beneath your boots echoes dully in the quiet. Cold moisture sticks to your face, chilling you to the bone with each breath, and you can feel the droplets gathering on your eyelashes, making the path ahead blur even further.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Displaced Beast</span></strong>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Forshadowing: The towering pines stand like sentinels, their branches creaking as a wind moves through the canopy above. The occasional rustle of unseen creatures in the underbrush keeps everyone on edge, the sound sharp against the relative stillness of the woods.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Setting: A group of Shadow Wargs, displaced by the Dead Wyrm\'s rampage, confronts the party in the forest. The Wargs look hungry but unsure whether to attack.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Approach:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Peaceful Resolution: An Animal Handling check (DC 17) combined with offering food (such as rations or caught game) can pacify the Wargs, convincing them to leave peacefully.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Combat Resolution: If attacked, the Shadow Wargs are fierce foes that blend in with the dark woods, requiring Perception checks to keep track of them.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Loot/Rewards:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Peaceful: One of the Wargs leads the party to a buried stash containing 40 gp and an Ivory Figurine of a howling wolf (worth 75 gp).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Combat: The party collects Shadow Wolf Fur (worth 25 gp each) that can be used by a leatherworker to make a Cloak of Resistance</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Necrotic Fog Trap</strong>\n<ul data-spread="false">\n<li>Foreshadowing: As you make your way deeper into the forest, the gentle murmur of a stream becomes audible, a soothing, rhythmic sound amidst the silence. The clear water glints faintly in the dappled sunlight that manages to pierce through the dense leaves. The cool breeze carries with it the slightly metallic tang of fresh mountain water mixed with damp earth. You dip your hand into the stream, feeling the icy sting that makes your fingers tingle.</li>\n<li>Description: A thick fog suddenly rises from the ground, filling a 30-foot radius. The fog is infused with necrotic energy.</li>\n<li>Mechanics: Any character entering or starting their turn in the fog must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or take 3d6 necrotic damage and suffer disadvantage on Wisdom checks for 1 hour.&nbsp;Perception or Nature check (DC 16) reveals faint symbols etched into the ground as the source of the fog.</li>\n<li>Disarm: A Religion or Arcana check (DC 15) can dispel the runes, dispersing the fog.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Wyrm\'s Breath Trap</strong><br>\n<ul data-spread="false">\n<li>Foreshadowing: The party stumbles into a small clearing dominated by a hollow, ancient oak. The tree&rsquo;s gnarled bark is rough beneath your fingers as you lean against it, the smell of aged, dry wood filling the air. A gentle breeze moves through the clearing, bringing with it the soft rustle of dried leaves scraping against each other like whispers. You take in a deep breath, and the air tastes faintly of the forest&mdash;damp earth and distant smoke, as if someone, somewhere, is burning wood.</li>\n<li>Description: IUnside the hollowed out oak is a large, dragon-headed statue that activates when the party steps in front of it, releasing a fiery cone of energy.</li>\n<li>Mechanics: Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 4d8 fire damage.</li>\n<li>Trigger: A hidden tripwire activates the trap. Perception check (DC 16) can spot the wire.</li>\n<li>Disarm: A Sleight of Hand check (DC 14) or Thieves\' Tools check (DC 15) can disable the mechanism. Alternatively, a</li>\n<li>Strength check (DC 18) can destroy the statue entirely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Crumbling Pathway Trap</strong>\n<ul data-spread="false">\n<li>Foreshadowing: Dark clouds gather suddenly overhead, and the first fat droplets of rain begin to pelt the forest. Each raindrop splashes against rock face, and the air quickly fills with the refreshing scent of warm rain. As the storm intensifies, you feel a your clothes beginning to cling to your skin. The sound of rain becomes a steady drumbeat, drowning out any other noises the forest might hold.</li>\n<li>Description: A narrow pathway begins to crumble and fall away beneath the party&rsquo;s feet.</li>\n<li>Mechanics:&nbsp;Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) to leap across or grab onto the ledge before falling.&nbsp;Falling characters take 3d6 bludgeoning damage unless they succeed on an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 15) to catch themselves halfway down.</li>\n<li>Disarm: Reinforcing the pathway is possible with a Strength or Survival check (DC 16) to make it stable enough for the party to cross safely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Arrival at Whisperwind Fortress</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Setting: The Ruins of Whisperwind</strong></p>\n<p>The ruins of Whisperwind Fortress loom above you, an imposing silhouette against the overcast sky. The wind howls through the shattered archways, carrying with it a biting chill that cuts through your cloaks. The scent of damp earth and decaying wood rises from the collapsed structures, and the path ahead is littered with debris&mdash;broken stones, splintered wood, and the occasional rusted piece of armor. The whole place feels hollow, haunted by whispers.</p>\n<p>The main gate of Whisperwind stands ajar, one side hanging by a single rusted hinge. As you push it open, the creak echoes through the courtyard, almost swallowed by the constant wind. The once-grand entrance now carries the stains of rust and old blood, a reminder of battles long past. Your steps echo through the emptiness, the sound bouncing off the cold stone walls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Collapse Timer</strong>: The ancient fortress is weakened. As soon as the party steps inside, a <strong>Collapse Timer</strong> &nbsp;begins.\n<ul>\n<li>Every <strong>15 in-game minutes</strong>, the DM rolls a <strong>d20</strong>. On a roll of <strong>15 or higher</strong>, part of the fortress collapses, potentially blocking paths, creating hazards, or revealing hidden chambers.</li>\n<li>Mechanics: Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 15) to leap out of the way of failling debris. Failing characters take 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Encounters within Whisperwind</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Grand Hall</strong>: As the party moves deeper, they encounter spectral apparitions of former residents&mdash;the spirits of the fallen soldiers and scholars who died during the attack by the <em>Dead Wyrm</em>. <br>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Combat Encounter</strong>: Spiritbound Sentinel Trap\n<ol>\n<li><em>Description</em><strong>:</strong> As the party enters a room, they disturb an ancient ward set by the spirits of the Order of Sea and Stone. This releases a spectral knight&mdash;a sentinel who attacks any intruder.</li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><em>Mechanics</em>:The sentinel emerges from a rune-marked tile when stepped on.<br></span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><em>Trigger</em>: Perception check (DC 15) to notice the ward marks on the ground before triggering it.<br>The spirit uses frightening presence, causing those within 10 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or be frightened for 1 minute.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><em>Disarm</em>: A successful Religion check (DC 16) can dispel the spirit or disable the ward before it activates.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The Barracks</strong>: A group of <strong>Scavengers</strong> has taken up residence in part of the ruins. They are hostile and territorial, attacking if the party gets too close. Negotiation may be possible, but they are wary of strangers.</li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>The Ancestral Athenaeum</strong>: The party finds a collapsed library.&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Investigation or Perception checks (DC 15)</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"> reveal valuable texts on the </span><em style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Bukhara Shard</em><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"> and the </span><em style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Dead Wyrm</em><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">. The texts reveal that the </span><em style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Shard</em><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"> is a powerful key used to control the planar rifts beneath the gates.</span>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Encounters</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Spectral Advisor\n<ol>\n<li>Setting: The party enters a room filled with old maps and scrolls, where a Spectral Advisor&mdash;a ghost of the former chief tactician&mdash;awaits, studying the maps in a loop.</li>\n<li>Approach:\n<ol>\n<li>Peaceful Resolution: The party can use History (DC 16) to discuss events in Whisperwind or Persuasion to calm the spectral figure. This may lead to a clue about the dragon&rsquo;s weaknesses or past tactics used against it.</li>\n<li>Combat Resolution: Failing to approach with respect or triggering the ghost&rsquo;s hostility will lead to a combat encounter with the Spectral Advisor who can call upon spectral knights.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Loot/Rewards:\n<ol>\n<li>Peaceful: The ghost provides the location of a hidden cache of potions in the fortress (contains 2 Potions of Greater Healing and a Potion of Fire Resistance).</li>\n<li>Combat: Looting the Spectral Advisor&rsquo;s remains provides a Ghostly Signet Ring (worth 150 gp) and a Scroll of Protection from Evil and Good.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>Traps</strong>:</span>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Spectral Chain Trap</span>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Description: When opening a specific bookshelf or disturbing certain scrolls, spectral chains shoot out, attempting to grapple the intruders.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Mechanics: </span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Strength saving throw (DC 15) or become restrained by the spectral chains.<br>Each round while restrained, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage.<br>The chains can be destroyed with a successful attack, AC 14, HP 20.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Disarm: A Religion check (DC 17) can be used to dispel the spectral magic binding the chains</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Echoing Descent Hall</span></strong>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Encounters</span>\n<ol>\n<li>Collapsed Corridor Ambush\n<ol>\n<li>Setting: As the party moves through a narrow hallway, they trigger a collapse, and out of the rubble emerge Wights that were buried in the original fall of Whisperwind.</li>\n<li>Approach:\n<ol>\n<li>Combat Resolution: The Wights immediately attack, attempting to drag the party members into the shadows.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Loot/Rewards:\n<ol>\n<li>The Wights carry Ancient Coins (worth 80 gp) and 3 Soul Shards, each of which can be used to gain a +1 bonus on a Death Saving Throw (single-use each).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Traps:</span>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Bukhara Shard-Activated Trap</span>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Description: A defense mechanism left by the Order of Sea and Stone, activated by the proximity of the Bukhara Shard.

The faint scent of incense becomes almost overwhelming, and an ethereal glow begins to coalesce in the center of the room. The spirit of Sir Meklen Renald appears, his eyes glowing faintly beneath the ghostly visage of his battle-worn armor. His voice is an echoing whisper, filled with a mix of sorrow and authority. His spectral presence chills the air around you, and you feel the weight of centuries of duty and regret pressing down upon you</li>\n<li><strong style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Interaction with Sir Meklen</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">: The spectral figure of </span><em style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Sir Meklen Renald</em><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"> appears as the party enters.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">[He gestures to the faded insignia of the Order of Sea and Stone, embedded in the crumbling wall behind him.]</p>\n<p>"Long ago, my father, Meklen Armash, fought the dragons that ravaged this land. He was a hero&mdash;a beacon of hope in a world set ablaze by dragon fury. He discovered their weakness, led our people through blood-soaked fields, and brought the dragons to their knees. I was just a child when he struck Tiamat down, ending that seven-year nightmare."</p>\n<p>[His gaze darkens, and his spectral form flickers slightly.]</p>\n<p>"But victory has a cruel price. The surviving dragons would not forgive, would not forget. Their hatred smoldered, then raged. They came for us&mdash;for my family. Whisperwind fell to their fury. They captured me, a boy of five, and buried me beneath the earth while my parents faced their wrath."</p>\n<p>[He glances at the party, grief and pride etched on his face.]</p>\n<p>"But I survived. I clawed my way out, driven by rage and grief. My parents\' bodies were all that greeted me. Only one other survived&mdash;Tim, Son of Scott, the last commander of my father\'s Resistance. He raised me, taught me what it meant to bear a legacy. And in time, I rebuilt Whisperwind. I founded the Order of Sea and Stone, to protect Coia as my father once did."</p>\n<p>[His voice drops, tinged with bitterness, his form flickering with emotion.]</p>\n<p>"But the truth is far more complicated. I was no Meklen Armash. I tried, but the ghosts of the past haunted every decision. I was too cautious, too fearful of making the wrong call, of risking those I loved. And in my fear, I sealed our fate."</p>\n<p>[He steps closer to the altar where the Aegis of Binding rests.]</p>\n<p>"The Dead Wyrm&mdash;a spirit born of a dragon my father slew&mdash;returned to claim what was left of us. <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The Wyrm\'s power was immense, and I feared that if we tried to destroy it and failed, it would then unleash its fury upon my loved ones</span>. <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Instead, I planned to imprison it beneath Whisperwind, believing that doing so would protect my family.&nbsp;</span> I allowed it to slaughter Whisperwind\'s defenders, hoping to weaken it enough to bind it beneath the fortress.

Your own father didn\'t think so."</p>\n<p>[The Dead Wyrm shifts, its serpentine body coiling around the chamber, its voice turning almost mocking.]</p>\n<p>"I see the fear in your eyes. You know the truth, don\'t you? That you are just as weak as they were. Renald thought he could imprison me, spare his precious family by chaining me beneath this crumbling fortress. But all he did was delay the inevitable. How many more will die for your family\'s folly?"</p>\n<p>[The dragon&rsquo;s eyes narrow, its voice growing darker, more insidious.]</p>\n<p>"You have the Aegis, yes&hellip; but do you even understand the power you hold?

The journey to <em>Whisperwind Fortress</em> takes them through dense forest and up into the mountains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forest is draped in a thick morning fog, the kind that clings to your skin like a damp cloak. The air smells earthy and rich, a mix of decaying leaves and fresh pine needles, while the crunch of damp twigs beneath your boots echoes dully in the quiet. Cold moisture sticks to your face, chilling you to the bone with each breath, and you can feel the droplets gathering on your eyelashes, making the path ahead blur even further.</p>\n                <p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Displaced Beast</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Forshadowing: The towering pines stand like sentinels, their branches creaking as a wind moves through the canopy above.

The clear water glints faintly in the dappled sunlight that manages to pierce through the dense leaves. The cool breeze carries with it the slightly metallic tang of fresh mountain water mixed with damp earth.

The tree&rsquo;s gnarled bark is rough beneath your fingers as you lean against it, the smell of aged, dry wood filling the air. A gentle breeze moves through the clearing, bringing with it the soft rustle of dried leaves scraping against each other like whispers. You take in a deep breath, and the air tastes faintly of the forest&mdash;damp earth and distant smoke, as if someone, somewhere, is burning wood.</p>\n<p>Description: IUnside the hollowed out oak is a large, dragon-headed statue that activates when the party steps in front of it, releasing a fiery cone of energy.</p>\n<p>Mechanics: Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 4d8 fire damage.</p>\n<p>Trigger: A hidden tripwire activates the trap.

The sound of rain becomes a steady drumbeat, drowning out any other noises the forest might hold.</p>\n<p>Description: A narrow pathway begins to crumble and fall away beneath the party&rsquo;s feet.</p>\n<p>Mechanics:&nbsp;Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) to leap across or grab onto the ledge before falling.&nbsp;Falling characters take 3d6 bludgeoning damage unless they succeed on an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 15) to catch themselves halfway down.</p>\n<p>Disarm: Reinforcing the pathway is possible with a Strength or Survival check (DC 16) to make it stable enough for the party to cross safely.</p>\n                \n',

As night descends on Rueside, the party finally tracks their target to the mysterious chapel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting Description</strong>:<br>The chapel is an ancient structure, looming in the shadows of the city. Cramped archways support its damp, stone interior, and the smell of mildew and old incense fills the air. The stained-glass windows are shattered and dark, reflecting the faint moonlight. Flashing lightning from an approaching storm briefly illuminates intricate carvings along the stone pillars, revealing the history of the Order and its battles against dragons and the Shadowfell.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>History</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Order of Sea and Stone</strong>: The chapel was originally established as a secret place of power by the Order, used for housing powerful relics and performing rituals tied to the Stone Gates.</li>\n<li><strong>Bukhara Shard</strong>: The Bukhara Shard is a remnant of ancient magic used to forge the Stone Gates of Coia. Andre has sought the Shard to protect the gates from Redevus&rsquo;s destructive goals.</li>\n<li><strong>The Assassination Plot</strong>: The party was manipulated into this mission by Redevus, who aims to eliminate Andre and take control of the Order to further his own vision for Coia&rsquo;s future.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Encounter Name: Andre's Approach</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>:<br>The air is heavy as the party watches from the shadows. Andre, disguised as an old woman, shuffles through a narrow alley. The dark street is deserted, with refuse scattered along the cobblestones, and the distant laughter of drunk patrons from the Pitt Inn drifts in the background. Lightning flashes, and Andre furtively approaches a small wooden door.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The narrow alley behind the Pitt Inn. The scene is filled with dark corners and discarded items, a perfect hiding spot for those looking to ambush or avoid notice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The alley smells of rot and stale ale. The door Andre approaches is cracked, the wood swollen from dampness. His footsteps echo off the walls, and the rustle of his cloak seems amplified in the silence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>The party must decide how to act as Andre pauses at the door and looks around, before unlocking it and slipping inside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interactions</strong>:<br>Just as the party is about to move, Carmine Calim appears from the shadows. His usual grin has a dangerous edge, and his eyes flick between the party members.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Dialogue Prompts</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><em>&ldquo;Did you really think you could just kill him and be done? No, no, I&rsquo;ve had bigger plans all along.&rdquo;</em></li>\n<li><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all just playing a game, friends.

A chill wind sweeps past them, and the runes briefly pulse with a faint red light.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The runes on the threshold are an ancient ward set by the Order, meant to protect the chapel from intruders. The runes glow with demonic energy, clearly corrupted by Ariel&rsquo;s influence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The air grows cold near the runes, and the scent of old incense becomes almost overwhelming. The runes hum with a low, menacing vibration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>The trap activates if someone steps over the threshold without disarming the runes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Disarm the Runes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 15 Arcana Check or DC 17 Sleight of Hand to carefully disrupt the runes&rsquo; magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Failure results in a pulse of necrotic energy dealing 3d6 damage and leaving the party member with disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws for the next hour.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cross the Threshold</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Constitution Saving Throw DC 16 to resist the necrotic pulse.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Failure deals 4d6 necrotic damage and weakens the character&rsquo;s magic resistance for the next encounter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Encounter Name: Betrayal in the Chapel</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>:<br>The chapel looms in darkness, its shadows deep and foreboding. The scent of mildew and incense fills the air, and each footstep echoes, amplifying the tension. The door creaks open, revealing the dim interior, filled with broken pews and shattered stained glass. As the party steps inside, they hear Carmine&rsquo;s mocking voice from behind them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The interior of the chapel is cold, with stained-glass windows that filter pale moonlight onto the cracked stone floor. The altar is in disrepair, and statues of old clerics stand vigil along the walls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The chapel is damp and cold, with a musky scent that sticks in the nostrils. The faint sound of dripping water echoes throughout, and flashes of lightning from outside create flickering shadows that seem to move on their own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>Carmine whistles sharply, and the Winter Guard&mdash;elite guards of the House of Silk&mdash;begin pouring in through the windows and side entrances. Andre, standing near the altar, drops his disguise, revealing his tired but resolute expression.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interactions</strong>:<br>Andre and Carmine both address the party. Andre claims to be protecting Coia, while Carmine reveals he&rsquo;s been using the party to get into the chapel for his own purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Dialogue Prompts</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Andre</strong>: <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been played, just as I thought. But you won&rsquo;t find me an easy target. I will protect the Gateway.&rdquo;</em></li>\n<li><strong>Carmine</strong>: <em>&ldquo;Trust me, this was never about Andre. The relic inside&mdash;that&rsquo;s what matters. Help me, and I promise you won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trust Carmine</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Group Stealth Check DC 17 to follow Carmine into a hidden passage without alerting the guards.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Following Carmine grants access to the hidden passage beneath the chapel and avoids a direct confrontation with the Winter Guard.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Andre escapes deeper into the chapel, and the opportunity to take him out is lost.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn on Carmine</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Initiative Roll to initiate combat against Carmine and the guards.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Defeating Carmine reveals the key to the hidden passage, but time is lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Andre uses the chaos to escape, summoning further defenders to impede the party&rsquo;s progress.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus on Andre</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Wisdom Saving Throw DC 18 to resist being lured away by Carmine&rsquo;s promises. Followed by an Arcana Check DC 16 to disable Andre&rsquo;s wards.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Successfully focusing on Andre means capturing or potentially killing him.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Engaging Andre directly triggers a full battle in the chapel, drawing in both the Winter Guard and animated chapel defenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Final Confrontation: Andre and the Bukhara Shard</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Location, Situation</strong>:<br>The heart of the chapel, beneath the flickering light of the Bukhara Spire Gateway, a structure of obsidian and runes that pulses with energy. Andre stands before it, holding the Bukhara Shard&mdash;his last line of defense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting Description</strong>:<br>The room is cavernous, with vaulted ceilings and murals depicting Coia's ancient battles. The Bukhara Spire Gateway glows at the center of the room, casting shadows of the statues that seem to watch over the encounter. Andre stands in the Spire&rsquo;s glow, gripping the Shard with determination.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encounter Name: Andre's Last Stand</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>:<br>As the party approaches, the ground beneath the Spire Gateway trembles, and dark energy seeps from the Bukhara Shard, resonating with the Gateway&rsquo;s power. The statues lining the walls begin to shift, and Andre&rsquo;s low voice carries through the echoing chamber.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The final confrontation takes place beneath the glowing Gateway, the floor cracked and glowing beneath Andre's feet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The air hums with energy, and the Shard&rsquo;s glow throws Andre&rsquo;s face into sharp relief, emphasizing the exhaustion and desperation in his eyes. The statues groan and shift, their movements resonating with the deep thrum of the Gateway.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>Andre channels the Shard's power, causing the Gateway to pulse with dark energy. The statues animate, and the fight begins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interactions</strong>:<br>Andre attempts to reason with the party, revealing Redevus&rsquo;s plan to destroy the Stone Gates and leave Coia defenseless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Dialogue Prompts</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><em>&ldquo;Redevus seeks to break the Weave itself, to sever the magic that binds our world together!&rdquo;</em></li>\n<li><em>&ldquo;What will you do now, with the power to shape the future in your hands?&rdquo;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Combat</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: Andre uses the Bukhara Shard to animate statues and channel spells. DC 18 Wisdom Saves to resist the effects of the Shard&rsquo;s necrotic energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Defeating Andre allows the party to take the Shard.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The Spire Gateway begins to destabilize, risking the collapse of the chapel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Parley</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 20 Persuasion Check to convince Andre to surrender.</li>\n<li><strong>Loot/Rewards</strong>: Andre surrenders the Shard, and the party gains his knowledge of the Gates.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Andre becomes a reluctant ally, but the Winter Guard continues their pursuit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Traps</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Trap Name: Gateway Collapse</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong>:<br>As the battle rages, the energy of the Gateway pulses erratically, and the ground beneath begins to crumble. The Spire's runes flicker, casting the room in flashes of shadow and light.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:<br>The Spire Gateway, unstable and dangerous, threatens to collapse, bringing the chapel down with it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensory Details</strong>:<br>The smell of burning ozone fills the air, and the hum of the Gateway grows into a deafening roar. The ground vibrates, and cracks spread from the Gateway, threatening to swallow the room.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong>:<br>The Gateway becomes unstable when Andre is defeated or surrenders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stabilize the Gateway</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanics</strong>: DC 18 Arcana Check to stabilize the Gateway using the Shard.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Success keeps the Gateway from collapsing, allowing a stable exit.

They leave with the Bukhara Shard, a powerful artifact that will help them in the coming battles. The assassination puts them directly at odds with the Order of Sea and Stone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If Andre is Captured</strong>:<br>Andre becomes a prisoner, offering valuable knowledge of the Gates. The Order may hunt the party to recover him, but Andre can be used to manipulate them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If Andre Joins Them</strong>:<br>An alliance with Andre shifts the campaign&rsquo;s balance. They gain an ally with deep knowledge of Coia&rsquo;s past, but they may lose Redevus's support, changing the course of their mission.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps: Whisperwind and Emberfield</strong>:<br>With the Bukhara Shard in hand, the party now knows they must travel to the distant gates at Whisperwind and Emberfield. Using the Shard, they can activate the gates or turn them into weapons. Their choices will shape the future of Coia and determine whether they save it or doom it to darkness.</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p>After a restless eight-hour stay at the Pitt Inn&mdash;a shabby establishment where the beds creak with every sigh and the walls hold the faint scent of mildew&mdash;the adventurers gathered in the dim light of early dawn. Rooster, Tiammen, Igan, and Boren (currently masquerading as a small, twitchy mouse) sat huddled around a table barely sturdy enough to hold their mugs of ale. The air was thick with tension and the lingering haze of cheap smoke. The conversation turned to their next moves, and inevitably, to Calim Carmine&mdash;a master thief whose words dripped with honey but whose eyes held all the warmth of a snake.</p>\n<p>Suspicion hung like a storm cloud over the table. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trusting a man who&rsquo;d rob the ring off your finger if you blinked,&rdquo; Rooster muttered, his gravelly voice betraying a distrust earned through a lifetime of hard knocks and hard lessons. There was a murmur of agreement. Calim had offered his services, flashing a sly grin and a promise of help that didn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes. But the party knew better than to trust words alone&mdash;especially when they came from a man as slippery as Calim.</p>\n<p>With grim resolve, the adventurers sketched out two possibilities. First, there was the matter of Igan&rsquo;s debts&mdash;a spider&rsquo;s web of trouble tangled up with a local bar. Burning it down would send a message, clear some debts, and maybe make Igan sleep a little easier. The second, more delicate matter involved Andre Malring, leader of the Order of Sea and Stone. Andre, ever the puppet master, had a hand in the kingdom&rsquo;s unfolding chaos. Rumors suggested he was playing both sides like a bard at a crossroads, and that made him dangerous. But killing him outright? That wasn&rsquo;t a decision to take lightly. Not when he was a key figure in a religious order tasked with guarding the ancient gates.</p>\n<p>Boren, back in his dwarven form, let out a low, thoughtful rumble. &ldquo;Murderin&rsquo; a man like that won&rsquo;t be a clean thing,&rdquo; he warned, his words heavy with hesitation. Even Rooster, rarely one to shy away from a fight, tapped his fingers nervously against the table. This wasn&rsquo;t just a petty thug or some twisted cultist; Andre was a complicated knot of alliances and intentions, and cutting him out might unravel more than they could handle.</p>\n<p>But in the end, the scales tipped toward action. The decision was made to ambush Andre near an abandoned bar under the cover of night. They spent the day scouting the area, eyes sharp for potential hideouts and escape routes. It was during this reconnaissance that something more troubling came to light&mdash;a connection between Andre, the ancient gates, and a mysterious artifact known as the Bukhara Shard. A strange shard that glowed with a golden light, carrying an ominous weight in their enemies&rsquo; plans.</p>\n<p>When night fell, they moved into position, the silence heavy with anticipation. Shadows clung to every corner, and the air was thick with the scent of rain on stone and old wood. But just as they were about to spring the trap, the plan took an unexpected twist. Carmine appeared from the darkness, as quiet and smooth as oil. He confronted Igan with a grin that held more teeth than humor, his fingers dancing close to the daggers at his belt. The tension was palpable, the kind that makes every heartbeat feel like a countdown.</p>\n<p>Through a series of tense negotiations and a few carefully placed enchantments, the party managed to turn Carmine to their cause, convincing the thief to help them infiltrate the chapel where Andre was conducting some kind of ritual involving a broken gate. A deal with a devil, perhaps, but it was the only way forward.</p>\n<p>Inside, the atmosphere was electric. The ruined chapel was a monument to another age, its crumbling stone walls etched with faded carvings and littered with the remains of broken pews. At its center stood Andre, silhouetted against the dim, flickering light of a glowing yellow stone&mdash;the Bukhart Shard. He was manipulating the gate, murmuring words in an ancient language, his expression grim and resolute.</p>\n<p>Boren, ever the diplomat, approached Andre with cautious words and measured steps. The dwarf&rsquo;s voice was low and steady as he probed Andre&rsquo;s intentions, trying to unravel the man&rsquo;s motives. Andre&rsquo;s eyes, sharp and weary, revealed the burden he carried. He spoke of protecting the gates, of the threat posed by Redevus&rsquo;s plan to sever the kingdom from its magic&mdash;an act that would turn the ancient gates into doorways to nothingness. His voice carried the conviction of a man who saw himself as the last line of defense against a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>Hidden in the shadows, Rooster and the others held their breath, weapons at the ready. Every muscle was coiled, every heartbeat loud in their ears. When Andre questioned whether Boren was alone, the moment of calm shattered. Rooster made the split-second decision to act, nocking an arrow and letting it fly with deadly precision, aiming to end both the ritual and, perhaps, Andre&rsquo;s life.</p>\n<p>But before the arrow found its mark, the chapel shuddered violently. The walls groaned and cracked, and dust rained down from the ceiling. &ldquo;The whole place is coming down!&rdquo; Tiammen shouted, the panic in her voice barely contained. In a mad scramble, they lunged forward, grabbing Andre just as the ceiling collapsed in a roar of stone and splintering wood.</p>\n<p>Outside, gasping for breath and covered in dust, the party took stock of their numbers. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Igan?&rdquo; someone shouted, eyes darting wildly in the darkness. For a gut-wrenching moment, they believed he had been buried beneath the rubble. But then, in a flash of light, Igan reappeared, having teleported back to the Pitt Inn just before the ceiling caved in.

                    "session_report": '<p>The night air is thick with tension as Redevus, leader of the Unchained, leans forward, his voice low and grave. "Only you know of this assassination plot," he says, eyeing each party member. "Some within the Unchained are still loyal to the Order and would warn Andre if they caught wind of it."</p>\n<p>Borin stands silent, torn between loyalty and duty. He won&rsquo;t stop you, but neither can he join. With a sharp nod, Redevus hands Borin a small stone and mutters an incantation. Before anyone can react, Borin shrinks into a squeaking mouse. Redevus deposits him in a small cage and hands him to Tiammen with a wry grin. "Here, take this. And if you need him back to normal, here&rsquo;s a scroll of <em>Dispel Magic</em>." His tone turns more serious as he waves you toward the supply tent. "Get what you need. But remember: stay within 200 feet of each other, or you&rsquo;ll die."</p>\n<h4>Sailing to Rueside:</h4>\n<p>The party decides to travel to Rueside by sea. The salt of the bay fills the air as Igan and Rooster row their dinghy ashore under a cool, gray sky, while Tiammen patrols the river, careful to keep within range. The sound of oars splashing against the water blends with distant gulls as the group concocts a ruse. Armed with freshly caught fish, they convince the guards they&rsquo;ve just been out on a harmless fishing trip. A few exchanged smirks and a chuckle later, the guards let them pass.</p>\n<p>Their first move is to contact Carmine Calim, Igan&rsquo;s elusive friend who supposedly knows everyone&rsquo;s secrets, including Andre&rsquo;s. His home, nestled in the Dockside District, reeks of damp wood and old cargo. After careful negotiations, Carmine makes it clear: he&rsquo;ll only help if the party lets him tag along. But there&rsquo;s a catch&mdash;he&rsquo;s got his eyes on something locked deep within the Hidden Relic Chapel, and he needs the party to get him there. He holds the key to the Chapel but has no clue where it lies. "You find the place, and I&rsquo;ll unlock it," he says, smug grin widening.</p>\n<h4>Dealing with the Smuggler:</h4>\n<p>Down at the docks, they meet a gruff smuggler willing to forge docking papers&mdash;for the staggering price of 5,000 gold. Igan, ever the quick thinker, offers something else instead: a secret passage beneath the Jolly Rojae tavern that leads outside the city. The smuggler is intrigued. "If your story checks out, you&rsquo;ll get your papers," she says, slipping into the night.</p>\n<p>As the tension mounts and guards begin to grow impatient, Rooster stalls, pretending to struggle with docking. The ship groans under the rough seas Igan conjures with a well-timed spell. Just when it seems the guards will lose patience, the smuggler returns with the papers, and the party breathes a collective sigh of relief. With little time to waste, they re-evaluate their plan. Instead of docking, they decide to anchor the ship just out of sight and use the secret passage.</p>\n<h4>A Close Encounter:</h4>\n<p>As the party makes their way toward the city, they spot a lavish caravan rolling down the road. Tiammen narrows his eyes. There, in the center carriage, is Cyla Winter, wife of one of the heads of the House of Silk, flanked by guards. They briefly consider an attack but ultimately decide against it. With the caravan rolling away, the party focuses on their next move.</p>\n<h4>The Jolly Rojae and Hofni Hardknot:</h4>\n<p>Inside the Jolly Rojae, the dim, smoky air smells of spilled ale and worn leather. The party huddles around a table, nursing pints of bitter ale. They decide to meet with Hofni Hardknot, a local bookie and Tiammen&rsquo;s contact. Igan, however, is hesitant&mdash;he owes Hofni money and doesn&rsquo;t expect a warm reception. When they meet, Hofni is as gruff as ever, eyeing the party with suspicion.</p>\n<p>Hofni offers them a deal: wipe Igan&rsquo;s debt and give them valuable information, but only if they take out the city&rsquo;s Captain of the Guard, Branor Ironear. If that&rsquo;s too much, he suggests a simpler task&mdash;burn down the Pitt Inn as a warning to those unwilling to pay his "brick insurance." The party agrees to burn the inn but secretly plans to double-cross Hofni.</p>\n<h4>Kjohn the Henchman:</h4>\n<p>As they leave Hofni&rsquo;s lair, they realize they&rsquo;re being tailed. Kjohn Moliarty, Hofni&rsquo;s clumsy henchman, practically trips over himself trying to stay hidden. They corner him in an alley, the sharp smell of trash and damp stone filling the air. Sensing an opportunity, the party offers him ten times Hofni&rsquo;s pay to join their ship&rsquo;s crew. His eyes widen at the offer, and he eagerly agrees before slinking off to a nearby brothel to await further instructions.</p>\n<h4>The Pitt Inn:</h4>\n<p>The Pitt Inn is a ramshackle building in the Low District, smelling of sweat, smoke, and strong spirits. Rooster&rsquo;s friend, Caelan, owns the place and greets them with a wary smile. After a few drinks, Caelan reveals a secret: Andre Malring, their target, passes by the inn every night at 10 p.m., disguised as an old woman. Caelan recognizes him by his gait, though Andre&rsquo;s cunning has kept most from noticing.</p>\n<p>The party shares Hofni&rsquo;s plot with Caelan, who promises to think up a ruse to fool Hofni. Grateful, Caelan offers them a room for the night, where they can rest and prepare for the chaos yet to come.</p>',

                    "description": '<h3>Opening Scene: Inside the Unchained&rsquo;s Command Tent</h3>\n<p>The unchained camp is a sea of semi-permanent white tents surrounded by rough-cut wooden walls. A motley assortment of freedom fighters scurry around the camp, while guards stand watchful on numerous watchtowers. In a small tent at the southeast corner of the camp, the&nbsp;tent flaps shudder with the breeze.<br><br>Inside Redevus Branch, leader of the Unchained, stands over a desk, its surface covered with various maps and papers. His eyes drift toward you all, now standing uneasily before him. Beside Redevus stands Lan, his second-in-command, stoic but alert. Behind them, Rollo sits in a corner, clearly drunk despiute the early morning hour. Grimgar, a stout and fearsome Dueregar, is standing to the side dressed in the markings of the Unchained. Seated before them is a group of fugitives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meklen Tiammen - A Dragonborn Guard in Rueside working for the House of Silk</li>\n<li>Borin Stonehammer - A dwarf acolyte in the House of Sea and Stone</li>\n<li>Igan Dot - A Human Con-Artist living in Rueside</li>\n<li>Edan \'Rooster\' Galan - A hermit Ranger living in the forests outside of Rueside.</li>\n<li>Harding Quickstop - A bard working at a Tavern in Rueside, The Pit, as the house musican</li>\n<li>Arcon Domini - A ne\'er-do-well and criminal that recently was released from prison in Rueside</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Redevus:</strong> <em>"Good Morning. Welcome. Make yourselves...comfortable. You\'ve been through much already&mdash;more than anyone could ask of a group such as yours. Possessed by far future descendants, pulled into battles not of your making, and now, here with us."</em></p>\n<p>His voice is firm but calm, as though he is explaining a simple truth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>"But, you see, our fight isn\'t over. I know each of you has a part to play in freeing Chichingia from the House of Silk, and the first step in that is righting the wrongs the Dragonbone Vanguard\'s commited in your names. I know you\'re not to blame for their actions, but what they did, while using your hands, needs to be set right."</em></p>\n<p>Lan walks around the desk and leans back, glancing between the party members. Her voice is soft, but also colder.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>"Redevus has bound you for your safety, and the safety of the Unchained. This bond, created during the \'exorcism\' of the Vanguard, ensures your survival, your loyalty, and, eventually, your freedom."</em> She pauses, her eyes on Igan and Rooster. <em>"We know this isn\'t easy to accept, but it&rsquo;s necessary. You know too much now. If the House of Silk were to capture even one of you, everything we&rsquo;ve worked for could crumble."</em></p>\n<p>Arcon, arms crossed, eyes blazing with defiance, takes a step forward. <em>"I didn&rsquo;t sign up to be anyone&rsquo;s puppet,"</em> he snaps, before turning his back on the tent. With a quick step, he storms toward the exit, the tension breaking with his angry strides. Harding, looking at the group with the same indignation, but less bombast, follows behind Arcon.</p>\n<p>For a few moments, Redevus says nothing, sorting papers on his desk as if revaluating. Moments later, the sound of a commotion outside the tent reaches them. An Unchained soldier rushes back in, carrying Harding&rsquo;s limp body.</p>\n<p>"I don\'t know what happend, they both just fell. This one, and the other big one."</p>\n<p>The guard seems genuinely distraught and confused by the turn of events.</p>\n<p>The shock spreads across the rest of the party like wildfire. The soldier lays Harding on the ground, her skin already paling, the life having drained from her in an instant. A sinking feeling hits them all at once.</p>\n<p>Redevus sighs, shaking his head but not without sympathy. <em>"I warned them. The bond, it&rsquo;s not just a leash&mdash;it&rsquo;s protection. Without it none of you, and I believe none of us, will survive."</em> His voice softens as he looks over the remaining party.&nbsp;<em>"I understand how this might feel, but this bond will keep you, and the Unchained, safe ... if you follow the rules. No one will betray us or what we are doing here, even accidentally."</em></p>\n<p>He gestures to Grimgar, standing tall, already outfitted in the armor of the Unchained. <em>"Grimgar understood. I&rsquo;ve released him from the bond because he&rsquo;s pledged his fealty to the cause and because he believes in what we&rsquo;re doing. </em><em>And I promise you this: When you&rsquo;ve completed your tasks&mdash;when you&rsquo;ve righted your wrongs and proved your loyalty&mdash;you will be freed."</em></p>\n<p>Lan steps up again, her voice more emphatic. <em>"It&rsquo;s not just about loyalty. It&rsquo;s about survival. The House of Silk already knows you. They&rsquo;ll be coming for you. Together, you have a chance to make things right. We&rsquo;re not asking for forever. Just long enough to secure the future&mdash;for yourselves and for Coia."</em></p>\n<p><strong>Redevus:</strong> <em>"None of you had asked for this&mdash; chose to be possessed or drawn into our revolution&mdash;but here you are, bound together by more than just fate. Once your tasks are done,&nbsp; you&rsquo;ll be free to choose your own paths. Until then, you&rsquo;ll need each other."</em> He pauses, giving them time to take it all in. <em>"I&rsquo;ll leave you now to decide how you want to proceed. When you are ready, come to the Command tent so we can brief you."</em></p>\n<p>With that, Redevus gathers a few papers, then he and Lan walk out as Rollo stumbles behind them.</p>\n<h3>Scene: The Briefing</h3>\n<p>Redevus stands at the center of the command tent, hands resting on the large oak table that dominates the space. The table is covered with maps, documents, and figurines representing strategic locations and cities. Around the edges of the tent are several high-ranking members of the Unchained, discussing and planning. Lan is at Redevus&rsquo;s side.</p>\n<p>As the party steps inside the dimly lit tent, the flaps close behind them with a whoosh, and the murmurs from the other commanders fade. Redevus looks up, offering a nod.</p>\n<p><strong>Redevus</strong>: "You&rsquo;ve come. Good." His tone is serious but not unkind. "Each task I am going to give you is crucial, but we cannot spare the resources to resolve them ourselves."</p>\n<p><strong>Lan</strong> steps forward, placing a hand on the edge of the map. "You were bound together not just to protect yourselves, but because we believe your destinies&mdash;whatever the Dragonbone Vanguard left behind&mdash;are tied to the fate of Coia. If you succeed, you will help us tip the balance in this war."</p>\n<p>She gives a small nod to Redevus, signaling for him to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Redevus</strong>: "Let&rsquo;s begin."</p>\n<p>He reaches for a carved figure of a dragon and places it on the map near Hearthhaven.</p>\n<p><strong>Redevus</strong>: "The first task. The Dead Wyrm has awoken." He looks at <strong>Meklen</strong> as he says this, his tone softening slightly, acknowledging the personal stakes.. "An undead dragon, bound to vengeance for over two hundred years. The goblins you... or rather, your possessed selves destroyed... they were somehow keeping it asleep through rituals and for a purpose we have yet to fully understand. Now that they&rsquo;re gone, the dragon is awoken. Reports have come that it has descended upon Hearthhaven, Tiammen&rsquo;s home. The Unchained can&rsquo;t fight both the House of Silk and an undead dragon. You must go there and stop it before it attacks more towns or worse."</p>\n<p><strong>Lan</strong> then taps on a figure of a town, placing it on another part of the map. "Emberfield. Your second task." Her voice is measured but firm. "A spirit you released on Stonewatch Island has begun to wrought havoc on the town. No word has come from Emberfield in days, and no messenger has returned. We need you to go there, find out what&rsquo;s happened, and resolve the situation before it expands beyond Emberfield."</p>\n<p>She pauses, letting the gravity of the task sink in, before stepping back slightly, giving the floor back to Redevus.</p>\n<p><strong>Redevus</strong>: "The third task is... more delicate." His eyes flick to <strong>Borin</strong> for a moment. "Andre Malring, the head of the Order of Sea and Stone, must be eliminated."</p>\n<p>He holds up a hand to forestall any protest. "We know this is dangerous, but Malring has been playing both sides for far too long. A leader in the Order with more of a spine could give us a major advantage. You&rsquo;ll need to infiltrate his estate and ensure he doesn&rsquo;t leave it alive."</p>\n<p>The tent falls silent for a moment, the weight of the missions heavy in the air. Redevus straightens, looking each party member in the eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Redevus</strong>: "I\'ll let you determine the priority of each task amonst yourselves. Once you complete all three tasks, the bond will be broken, and you will be free to go your own ways. But until then, you need each other, and we need you."</p>\n<p>He steps back, his posture easing slightly. "Take some time. Prepare yourselves. You&rsquo;ll need all the strength you can muster for what&rsquo;s ahead."</p>\n<p>As the party processes the enormity of their tasks, <strong>Lan</strong> steps forward once more.</p>\n<p><strong>Lan</strong>: "When you&rsquo;re ready, we&rsquo;ll get you equipped and send you on your way. This war, our future&mdash;Coia&rsquo;s future&mdash;depends on you. Together, you can survive and change everything."</p>\n<p>The room is still, the tension thick as the party stands at the crossroads of their journey.</p>\n<h2>Available Supplies:</h2>\n<h3>Standard Adventuring Supplies:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Rations (10 days)</strong> &ndash; Dried meats, bread, and fruits to sustain the party during their travels.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Skins (1 per person)</strong> &ndash; Essential for hydration during long journeys.</li>\n<li><strong>Torches (10)</strong> &ndash; Basic light sources for caves, catacombs, or dark forests.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope (100 feet, hempen)</strong> &ndash; Sturdy and reliable for climbing, securing items, or tying up enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Tent (1 large)</strong> &ndash; Weather-resistant tents to provide shelter for the party.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Gear</strong> &ndash; Includes pitons, grappling hooks, and spiked boots for navigating difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><strong>Shovel &amp; Pickaxe</strong> &ndash; Useful for digging, clearing debris, or creating defensive positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Weapons and Armor:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Silvered Weapons (2 sets)</strong> &ndash; A longsword and a dagger, both silvered to deal with creatures vulnerable to such materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Silvered Crossbow Bolts (50)</strong> &ndash; A supply of standard and silver-tipped bolts for ranged combat.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Armor (Studded Leather)</strong> &ndash; For party members without magical protection, providing increased mobility and defense.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Magical Items:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Potion of Greater Healing (1 each)</strong> &ndash; More potent healing (4d4+4 healing).</li>\n<li><strong>Scroll of Lesser Restoration (1)</strong> &ndash; To cure a debilitating condition, such as poison or disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Dust of Disappearance (1 pouch)</strong> &ndash; Allows the user to turn invisible for 2d4 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Potion of Fire Breath (1)</strong> &ndash; Grants the ability to exhale fire for a short period (3 uses, 4d6 fire damage in a 30-foot line).</li>\n<li><strong>Scroll of Identify (1)</strong> &ndash; A scroll to quickly identify any magical items or cursed objects found during their journey.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Specialized Gear:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dragon Bane Crossbow (1)</strong> &ndash; A heavy crossbow enchanted to deal extra damage to dragons (+2d6 damage against dragon-type creatures).</li>\n<li><strong>Warding Amulet (1)</strong> &ndash; These amulets grant temporary protection against necrotic damage (resistance to necrotic damage for 1 hour per long rest).</li>\n<li><strong>Lantern of Revealing (1)</strong> &ndash; A lantern that reveals invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet of its light.</li>\n<li><strong>Cold Iron Shackles (2 sets)</strong> &ndash; These shackles are designed to bind and weaken extraplanar creatures or undead, making them easier to subdue.</li>\n<li><strong>Folding Boat (1)</strong> &ndash; A portable boat that folds into a small box, useful for crossing rivers or lakes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Miscellaneous:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Map of Hearthhaven and Emberfield</strong> &ndash; Detailed maps showing the layout of Hearthhaven and the surrounding regions, along with what little is known about the state of Emberfield.</li>\n<li><strong>Bag of Caltrops (1 bag)</strong> &ndash; Small spiked metal balls, designed to impede pursuit by foot.</li>\n<li><strong>Antitoxin (3 vials)</strong> &ndash; Grants advantage on saving throws against poison for one hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Tactical Information:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unchained Insignia (6)</strong> &ndash; Wearing this small badge offers safe passage through certain territories controlled by the Unchained.

Inside the command tent, Redevus Branch stands hunched over a desk littered with maps. <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Beside him, Lan, is rigid, almost cold&mdash;her presence a silent warning that she suffers fools even less than Redevus. And then there&rsquo;s Rollo, slumped in the corner, stinking of alcohol, red-faced and swaying like a tree in the wind. Rollo&rsquo;s already deep into his cups. Meanwhile, Grimgar, the Duergar, looms like a grim statue, his arms folded across his barrel chest, the markings of the Unchained proudly etched into his armor.</span></p>\n<p>And before them all stands your motley group of fugitives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meklen Tiammen</strong>&mdash;a Dragonborn guard with ties to the House of Silk, now a man fighting to save his cursed lineage.</li>\n<li><strong>Borin Stonehammer</strong>&mdash;a grizzled dwarf, once an acolyte of the House of Sea and Stone, now struggling with the weight of impossible decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Igan Dot</strong>&mdash;a sly human con artist, forever calculating odds and angles, even as the walls close in.</li>\n<li><strong>Edan "Rooster" Galan</strong>&mdash;a hermit ranger with eyes as wild as the forests he haunts.</li>\n<li><strong>Harding Quickstop</strong>&mdash;a bard with a quick wit, now silenced, staring daggers at the command tent walls.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcon Domini</strong>&mdash;a career criminal, recently sprung from prison, burning with defiance and more than a little bitterness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The weight of the room presses in as Redevus finally speaks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Good morning.

Possessed by descendants from a far-flung future, thrust into battles you never sought, and now, you stand here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He talks about wrongs to be set right, about how you&rsquo;re bound to the cause of the Unchained whether you like it or not. His words are pragmatic, but there&rsquo;s a deeper undercurrent. They&rsquo;re more a warning than a plea.</p>\n<p>Lan steps forward, her voice like ice over a burning fire. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t choose this bond, but it&rsquo;s necessary&mdash;for your safety, and ours.&rdquo; Her eyes settle on Igan and Rooster. &ldquo;Without it, you wouldn&rsquo;t last a day. And if the House of Silk captured even one of you, our cause would be undone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The tension breaks as Arcon, ever the stubborn dissenter, steps forward. His eyes flash with anger. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sign up to be anyone&rsquo;s puppet,&rdquo; he spits, storming toward the exit. Harding follows, less fiery but no less resolute.</p>\n<p>Moments later, the air outside crackles with commotion. An Unchained soldier bursts back in, carrying Harding&rsquo;s limp body. Her skin is pale, drained of life. The bond had exacted its price.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I warned them. Without the bond, none of you will survive.&rdquo; Redevus\'s voice is low, almost sympathetic, but there&rsquo;s a hardness in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Grimgar&rsquo;s presence looms larger now. Redevus gestures toward him. &ldquo;Grimgar understood. He pledged his loyalty, and I released him from the bond.

There&rsquo;s much to be done, and little time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lan steps forward, her hand hovering over the map. &ldquo;The bond between you was no accident. We believe your fate is tied to that of Coia. If you succeed, you&rsquo;ll turn the tide in this war.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Redevus reaches for a dragon figurine, placing it near Hearthhaven. &ldquo;The Dead Wyrm,&rdquo; he says, his voice dropping as his eyes meet Meklen&rsquo;s. &ldquo;An undead dragon, hunting the Tiammen family for generations. The goblins you destroyed, they were keeping it asleep. Now, it&rsquo;s loose, and it&rsquo;s already attacked your home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The map seems to darken as he speaks. Lan places another figure near a town. &ldquo;Emberfield,&rdquo; she says, her tone grim. &ldquo;The spirit you released on Stonewatch Island is ravaging the town. We&rsquo;ve heard nothing from the town or its messengers. You need to stop it before it spreads.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Redevus&rsquo;s voice cuts back in. &ldquo;Your third task is&hellip; delicate. Andre Malring, head of the Order of Sea and Stone, must be eliminated.&rdquo; He glances at Borin, eyes steady. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s playing both sides. If we&rsquo;re to win this war, he cannot live.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Redevus steps back, giving the party space. &ldquo;Once these tasks are complete, you&rsquo;ll be free to go. But until then, you need each other.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lan, stepping forward one last time, echoes his words. &ldquo;Together, you can survive. Together, you can change the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ready or not, the party must decide: face the tasks, or fall beneath the crushing weight of fate.</p>',

The outpost itself is a small wooden fortification, built hastily on the frontier to protect nearby villages from the encroaching threats of raiders and barbarians. Bishop Cyril Brazen, a powerful but shrewd figure, has placed Gerhart in command of this outpost, recognizing his potential but offering no reinforcements.<br>Describe the fort:<br>The walls of the outpost are tall but battered, made from rough timber. There are no more than a dozen guards here, including the player characters. The tension is palpable; the air is cold, the sun setting, casting long shadows as night approaches.</p>\n<p>The Barbarian Horde Approaches<br>As night falls, the outpost\'s scouts return, breathing heavily, fear in their eyes. They barely manage to speak before collapsing at the gates. One scout, gasping for breath, finally gets the words out:<br>"The horde... they\'re coming."<br>The sound of war drums and distant war cries grows louder by the second. The barbarian horde approaches&mdash;savage, relentless, and ready to overrun the small outpost.<br>Let the players prepare: Give the players a few moments to discuss strategy and take any defensive actions. They might want to prepare spells, position guards on the walls, or even attempt a speech to rally the troops. Whatever they decide, they should feel the weight of the impending battle.</p>\n<p>The First Wave: The Horde Attacks<br>Suddenly, the barbarians are upon them. Dark figures move swiftly through the trees, and the outpost is assaulted by waves of savage warriors. The players (the guards) must defend the walls, repel the invaders, and try to hold their ground.<br>Combat encounter:<br>Describe how the barbarians climb the walls, throwing themselves into the fray with reckless abandon.<br>The players can lead their NPC guards in defense while fighting off barbarians themselves.<br>The attacks are brutal, and the defense is desperate. Make the players feel like they&rsquo;re holding on by a thread, using everything they can to keep the barbarians at bay.</p>\n<p>The Turning Point: Near Overwhelmed<br>As the battle rages, the situation becomes dire. Despite the best efforts of the guards, the horde continues to press forward. Describe a moment where the walls are breached, and barbarians start pouring into the outpost.<br>The player characters may find themselves surrounded, fighting back-to-back with their comrades. Gerhart&rsquo;s best friend, Talon Blackwood, fights bravely at Gerhart&rsquo;s side, a steadfast and loyal ally. But even Talon, for all his strength, begins to tire.<br>This is where the players start to fall.<br>Describe the enemy numbers swelling.<br>One by one, the players (the guards) are struck down, falling either unconscious or gravely wounded. The chaos of battle surrounds them as the barbarians push through.</p>\n<p><br>The Aftermath: Death and Grief<br>When the dust settles, silence falls over the battlefield. The outpost is all but destroyed, and the bodies of guardsmen litter the ground. All the player characters are dead or dying, and Talon Blackwood lies lifeless, his body near Gerhart&rsquo;s.<br>Describe Gerhart\'s reaction:<br>Gerhart, barely standing, surveys the devastation. His eyes fall on Talon, and a crushing grief overtakes him. Every friend and ally he had fought with now lies motionless.</p>\n<p>The Awakening of Gerhart&rsquo;s Magic<br>As Gerhart kneels beside Talon&rsquo;s lifeless body, his grief becomes overwhelming. His sorrow manifests as raw, untapped magic, a force he didn&rsquo;t even know he possessed. His hands begin to glow faintly, and the ground beneath him trembles with power.<br>Let the players feel the shift:<br>The air around Gerhart hums with magic.<br>Slowly, the bodies of the guards around him begin to stir. All the fallen guards (the player characters) start to groan back to life, the magic of Gerhart&rsquo;s grief filling their bodies and knitting their wounds.<br>Describe the moment with Talon:<br>Gerhart places his hands on Talon&rsquo;s chest, tears falling onto his friend&rsquo;s body. He pours every ounce of magic he has into his fallen comrade, willing him to return to life. The magic flows through Gerhart&rsquo;s body, but Talon doesn&rsquo;t stir. He channels more and more, until the magic begins to consume him.<br>This is when Gerhart learns his most powerful healing spells&mdash; Mass Healing Word, Mass Cure Wounds, and eventually Resurrection. But despite his efforts, Talon remains lifeless.</p>\n<p>The Emotional Climax: Talon&rsquo;s Final Farewell<br>No matter how hard Gerhart tries, he cannot bring Talon back. Let the players feel the weight of this moment as Gerhart&rsquo;s magic fades, and Talon remains still. Talon&rsquo;s death, despite Gerhart&rsquo;s immense power, becomes a defining moment in his life&mdash;one that will shape him forever.<br>Gerhart, exhausted and grief-stricken, rises to his feet, his magic now spent. The other guards (the players) are alive, but Talon is gone.</p>\n<p>Ending Act 1: The Aftermath<br>The outpost is destroyed, the bodies of the barbarians lie scattered around, and Gerhart stands as a broken, yet newly empowered, figure. The magic that had been dormant within him has awakened, but it came at a great cost. His comrades live, but Talon is lost forever.</p>\n<p>DM Notes for Key Moments:<br>Barbarian Attack: Make this encounter feel intense but winnable, allowing the players to experience the chaos and desperation of the defense.<br>The Fall of the Players: Ensure that each player&rsquo;s character falls in battle at some point. Make it feel personal, with dramatic descriptions of their final moments.<br>Gerhart&rsquo;s Awakening: Describe this moment with a lot of emotion, showing how grief unlocks his latent magic. The visual and emotional impact should be powerful.<br>Talon&rsquo;s Death: This is the heart of the act. Talon&rsquo;s loss is a deeply personal moment for Gerhart and the emotional anchor for his character development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ACT 2: THE SEARCH FOR PEACE<br>Here&rsquo;s an initial description and intro to set the scene for Gerhart&rsquo;s training at the mountain monastery:</p>\n<p>The Monastery of the Forsaken Cliffs<br>Perched high in the frozen peaks of the Cocker Mountains, the monastery clings to the rock face like a scar on the world. From a distance, it is almost impossible to see&mdash;its walls blend with the jagged cliffs, and the winding path leading to it is no more than a treacherous thread hanging over endless chasms. The winds howl constantly here, rattling through the stone corridors and shaking the iron bells that hang from the highest towers. The cold bites to the bone, but the monks who dwell here seem unaffected, their bodies hardened by the harsh environment, their minds disciplined beyond the breaking point.<br>The monastery is as unforgiving as the monks who call it home. There is no comfort here, no softness. Only stone, silence, and the endless trials of training. The stone floors are worn smooth by generations of warriors who have come to this place seeking enlightenment through pain, strength through suffering. Few ever leave.<br>How Gerhart Arrived<br>Gerhart had heard whispers of the monks during his travels&mdash;rumors of a hidden order that trained only the most determined, the ones willing to risk everything to unlock their inner potential. For months, he journeyed through the mountains, his body pushed to its limits by the biting cold and treacherous terrain, driven by the need to find this place, to test himself in ways he had never imagined.<br>It was after a particularly brutal night, when the cold had nearly claimed him, that a figure emerged from the mists. A monk, silent and robed in heavy furs, guided him to the monastery without a word. Now, standing in the shadow of its towering gates, Gerhart knew he had found the place where his true journey would begin.</p>\n<p>&ndash; - BREAK - &ndash;<br>The Head Monk<br>The air in the courtyard was thick with the scent of ancient stone and the bitter cold of the mountain wind. The head monk stood at the far end, shrouded in shadows cast by the towering walls of the monastery. His face was mostly hidden beneath the hood of his heavy robe, but his presence was undeniable&mdash;an aura of quiet authority, sharpened by years of unspoken knowledge.<br>He spoke slowly, his voice low, as if the words were being drawn from deep within the mountain itself.<br>"You have come far to stand in this place," he began, each word carrying weight, "but the journey has only begun. This monastery does not seek students, nor does it offer instruction. We are not here to teach, only to reveal. What you uncover here will not be handed to you. It must be taken, through trials that will strip you of all you believe you know of strength, of endurance, of life."<br>The wind picked up for a moment, howling through the courtyard, but the monk remained still, his gaze fixed on the group.<br>"Before we proceed, know this: our ways are not like others. You will not question the trials. You will not hesitate when commanded. You will do as the order demands, or you will be cast from this mountain&mdash;either in body or in spirit. There will be no exceptions."<br>He stepped forward into the dim light, revealing a lined face, ageless and weathered by the passage of countless years. His eyes seemed to pierce through to the soul of each initiate as he continued, his voice now a whisper that somehow carried through the biting wind.<br>"To remain here, you must speak a vow, one of silence and obedience. You will surrender your will to ours. You will question nothing, for those who do not trust the order will not survive the first trial."<br>He waited, letting the silence stretch uncomfortably long. The cold began to gnaw at the edges of awareness, the wind swirling relentlessly around them.<br>"Speak now," the monk finally said, "and bind yourselves to the trials of this place. Agree to our terms, or leave these cliffs and never return. Those who stay will know suffering. And through suffering, you may&mdash;if you are worthy&mdash;find strength."<br>Each of the initiates was forced to respond. Silence hung in the air, waiting for them to commit fully to the unknown.<br>Once all had given their agreement, the head monk nodded slowly.<br>"You have spoken, and now you belong to the mountain. To the order."<br>He turned and gestured to the abyss beyond the cliff&rsquo;s edge.<br>"Your first lesson awaits."</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>Meditation on the Edge</p>\n<p>Head Monk:<br>"Strength of the body is a fleeting thing. Strength of the mind&mdash;that is eternal. You will float at the cliff&rsquo;s edge, where the ground falls away beneath you, where death beckons like an old friend. Your task is simple: remain in the air, keep your mind focused. Lose yourself for even a moment, and the wind will claim your soul. Only those who can find peace amidst chaos will be worthy of this path. The edge of life and death is where a true monk finds his balance."<br>Mini-Game 1: Meditation on the Edge<br>Goal: Stay in a meditative trance while floating off the edge of a cliff.<br>Mechanics:<br>You must make three Concentration saving throws (DC 15).<br>Fail one save: You start to lose focus but remain in the air.<br>Fail two saves: You lose your trance completely and fall to your death.<br>You succeed if you pass all three saves, remaining in your meditative state.<br>"You will float off the cliff&rsquo;s edge. Maintain your focus or plummet. Three rounds, three saves."</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pain Tolerance</p>\n<p>Head Monk:<br>"Pain. It is the body&rsquo;s way of begging for mercy. But you will give it none. Today, your body will be tested, and you will learn to ignore its pathetic cries. Today, you will feel the sting of weakness. But remember&mdash;weakness does not exist. It is only the mind&rsquo;s trick. Strength lies in enduring the blows, in knowing that pain is but a fleeting guest. To survive, you must conquer it. To be strong, you must embrace it."<br>Mini-Game 2: Pain Tolerance Test<br>Goal: Endure the pain of surprise attacks without succumbing.<br>Mechanics:<br>You are surrounded by 6 monks. Each round, one of them will strike you.<br>I will roll a d6 to determine which monk attacks.<br>You must guess if the attack comes from the front or the back (choose 3 monks).<br>If your guess is correct, roll a saving throw to resist the attack (based on the monk\'s attack type: Strength, Dexterity, etc.).<br>If you get hit twice, you must make a Constitution save (DC 14). Fail, and you die.<br>"Six monks will attack, one per round. Guess front or back, resist the blow, and endure the pain."<br>Strength of Will and Body</p>\n<p>Head Monk:<br>"Before you stands a tree. It will not move. It will not bend. It will not give way easily&mdash;just like life&rsquo;s greatest challenges. But you are not just fists and bone. You are spirit, and spirit bends the world to its will. Break this tree with your hands, channel your energy. For a monk, there is no retreat, no surrender. You will break this tree, or it will break you."&nbsp;<br>Mini-Game 3: Break the Tree<br>Goal: Destroy a tree using nothing but your fists, or if necessary, your head.<br>Mechanics:<br>You will punch the tree 5 times. Roll 5d6.<br>If the total is below 16, you break your main hand.<br>You get one more chance: roll an additional d6. If your combined total is still below 16, you break your other hand.<br>If both hands are broken, you must use your head. Roll a d20.<br>If your d20 roll is below 16, you die trying to headbutt the tree.<br>"You have 5 punches to destroy the tree. Fail, and you will break both hands. You must keep going."</p>\n<p><br>Free-for-All Battle</p>\n<p>Head Monk:<br>"You have endured much, but endurance alone is not enough. In battle, only the strongest survive. You are not brothers here, not today. Today, you are enemies. Each of you has tasted strength, but only one of you will join our order. Only one will prove that they can stand among us. Fight as though your life depends on it, for it does. The last one standing is worthy of our brotherhood. The rest? You will join the ranks of those who have fallen before you."<br>Final Mini-Game: Free-for-All Battle<br>Goal: Be the last one standing in a battle against your fellow monks.<br>Mechanics:<br>This is a free-for-all combat where you will fight the other initiates (the other players).<br>The last player left standing wins the challenge and is allowed to join the order.<br>"Fight your fellow monks. The last one alive joins the order."</p>',

Gerhart Duskwood, the stalwart commander of this forsaken outpost, stands with his comrades on the threshold of despair. The wooden walls around them, no more than a dozen feet high, groan and creak like the bones of some ancient beast. They were thrown up in haste to keep the wilderness at bay&mdash;barbarians, raiders, and all manner of lurking dangers that the king&rsquo;s armies were too preoccupied to deal with.</p>\n<p>The air is sharp with cold, and night is slinking in on the heels of the setting sun. The light bleeds red and orange over the horizon, casting long, jagged shadows across the outpost. The guards&rsquo; faces are set, eyes squinting into the gathering gloom. Only a dozen men stand against the approaching night, and every one of them feels it&mdash;the weight of coming doom.</p>\n<p>And who, you ask, left them in this mess? That would be Bishop Cyril Brazen, a cunning and calculated man, one with enough shrewdness to place Gerhart in charge here but not enough generosity to send any backup. Why waste resources, right? After all, a good commander earns his stripes in blood.</p>\n<p>Just as the sun dips below the trees, the outpost&rsquo;s scouts stagger back through the gates, wide-eyed and gasping like they&rsquo;ve been chased by death itself. One of them collapses, clutching his side. His voice rasps out, barely a whisper.</p>\n<p>"The horde&hellip; they&rsquo;re coming."</p>\n<p>Then, on cue, the low, rhythmic pounding of war drums echoes from the distance, and with it comes the unmistakable roar of savage voices. It starts low, but quickly swells into a storm of guttural chants. The barbarians, a relentless, blood-hungry horde, have arrived.</p>\n<p><em>The First Wave: The Horde Attacks</em></p>\n<p>And just like that, the sky darkens with movement. Out of the trees, they come&mdash;a horde of wild-eyed, battle-scarred warriors, faces painted with blood and malice. They move with the precision of wolves and the fury of a storm, crashing into the outpost&rsquo;s meager defenses. The walls groan again, this time under the assault of axes and fists. The wood splinters, shrieking as the barbarians claw at it with primal hunger.</p>\n<p>The guards barely have time to react. The clash of steel, the sharp tang of blood in the air, the thud of bodies hitting the ground&mdash;it all melds into a symphony of chaos. The players fight tooth and nail, defending the walls, but the sheer number of enemies makes it feel like holding back a flood with bare hands. The battle is relentless, brutal, and savage. Every swing of a blade comes with the risk of death.</p>\n<p><em>The Turning Point: Near Overwhelmed</em></p>\n<p>And then, the inevitable happens&mdash;the walls are breached. A deafening crack splits the air as part of the outpost collapses, and barbarians begin to pour through the opening like rats through a hole in a ship. Inside, it&rsquo;s bedlam. The players find themselves surrounded, backs pressed against one another as they struggle to fend off the tide of bodies. Swords clash, arrows fly, and blood stains the earth.</p>\n<p>Talon Blackwood, Gerhart&rsquo;s closest friend, fights alongside him with all the strength he can muster, but even Talon&mdash;mighty, reliable Talon&mdash;begins to falter. His breath comes in ragged gasps, and his swings slow. The barbarians are endless. One by one, Gerhart&rsquo;s comrades fall, some dead, others grievously wounded. Talon himself takes a brutal hit, collapsing at Gerhart&rsquo;s side.</p>\n<p>The horde continues to push forward, a dark sea of flesh and fury. Soon, all is lost.</p>\n<p><em>The Aftermath: Death and Grief</em></p>\n<p>When the dust settles, silence&mdash;an eerie, oppressive silence&mdash;blankets the battlefield. The outpost is no more than a pile of splintered wood and the crumpled bodies of guardsmen. Their blood soaks into the earth, a testament to their futile resistance. Gerhart, barely standing, surveys the devastation, his heart heavy with grief. His gaze lands on Talon&mdash;his best friend, his brother-in-arms&mdash;now lifeless, his body lying among the wreckage.</p>\n<p>Grief hits Gerhart like a hammer blow, so raw and powerful it leaves him breathless. He drops to his knees beside Talon, hands trembling as he touches his friend&rsquo;s cold skin. Around him, the wind howls, carrying with it the stench of blood and death.</p>\n<p>And then, something stirs within Gerhart. At first, it&rsquo;s a flicker, a small pulse of power. But it grows, spreading through his veins like wildfire. His hands begin to glow with a faint, ethereal light, and the air hums with magic&mdash;a magic Gerhart had never known he possessed.</p>\n<p><em>The Awakening of Gerhart&rsquo;s Magic</em></p>\n<p>Raw, untamed energy surges from Gerhart&rsquo;s grief. His fingers spark with life, and beneath him, the ground trembles. Slowly, the bodies of his comrades, those who had been dead moments before, begin to stir. Groans of pain escape their lips as Gerhart&rsquo;s magic knits their wounds, drawing them back from the brink of death.</p>\n<p>But Talon&hellip; Talon remains still.</p>\n<p>Desperate, Gerhart places his hands on his fallen friend&rsquo;s chest, pouring every ounce of magic into him. His tears fall onto Talon&rsquo;s face, mingling with the blood there. He begs, pleads, demands that Talon come back. But no matter how much power Gerhart summons, no matter how hard he tries, Talon does not move. The magic drains from Gerhart, leaving him exhausted, but Talon&rsquo;s body remains cold.</p>\n<p><em>The Emotional Climax: Talon&rsquo;s Final Farewell</em></p>\n<p>The moment stretches into eternity. Gerhart&rsquo;s hands fall limp, his magic spent, his heart shattered. Talon is gone. No matter how much power Gerhart has awakened, it isn&rsquo;t enough. Talon&rsquo;s death is final, and it will haunt Gerhart forever.</p>\n<p>The remaining guards stir, alive but broken. Around them, the outpost lies in ruins, and the bodies of the barbarian horde are scattered across the ground like discarded toys. And there, amidst the destruction, Gerhart stands&mdash;grief-stricken, yet newly empowered. The magic that had slumbered within him has awakened, but it came at a great cost. Talon is gone, and nothing will ever be the same.</p>\n<h3>Act 2: The Search for Peace</h3>\n<p><strong>The Monastery of the Forsaken Cliffs</strong></p>\n<p>The Monastery of the Forsaken Cliffs lies in the frigid peaks of the Cocker Mountains, perched perilously above endless chasms. Hidden from sight, it blends into the jagged rock face, its walls as cold and unyielding as the wind that eternally howls through its stone corridors. The monastery is not a place of comfort, but of discipline and pain. Here, only the strongest can endure the brutal training that promises to unlock the deepest potential within. The cold bites into the bones, yet the monks remain unaffected&mdash;hardened and disciplined beyond the breaking point.</p>\n<p>For centuries, warriors have come to the monastery seeking enlightenment through suffering. Few leave. Those who remain commit to the trials, pushing their bodies and minds to limits they never imagined possible. This is where Gerhart begins his journey</p>\nScene 1: Gerhart\'s Arrival\n<p>Gerhart had wandered the frozen mountains for months, seeking the monastery that only the most determined warriors could find. His journey had pushed his body to the brink of collapse. Finally, a silent monk guided him through the mists to the monastery&rsquo;s towering gates, where his true test would begin. Gerhart reaches the monastery gates, knowing his path will now be one of unimaginable trials.</p>\nScene 2: The Head Monk\n<p>The head monk is a figure of quiet authority, his presence unmistakable. He speaks slowly, his words heavy with purpose. He tells the initiates that the monastery is not a place of instruction, but of revelation. Through brutal trials, they will be stripped of all they know of strength, endurance, and life. To remain, they must vow silence and obedience.</p>\n<p>"You have come far to stand in this place, but the journey has only begun... Speak now, and bind yourselves to the trials of this place. Agree to our terms, or leave these cliffs and never return. Those who stay will know suffering. And through suffering, you may&mdash;if you are worthy&mdash;find strength." The initiates are given a choice to either stay and face the unknown or leave. Gerhart, with determination, vows his silence and obedience, committing to the trials.</p>\nScene 3: Meditation on the Edge\n<p>The first trial tests the strength of mind. The initiates must meditate at the cliff&rsquo;s edge, where the ground falls away beneath them. They must float off the cliff and remain focused&mdash;losing themselves to the chaos of the wind will result in death.</p>\n<p>"Strength of the body is a fleeting thing. Strength of the mind&mdash;that is eternal. You will float at the cliff&rsquo;s edge... Only those who can find peace amidst chaos will be worthy of this path." Initiates must pass three rounds of saves to maintain focus or plummet to their deaths. Only two initiates, including Gerhart, maintain focus. Those who fall reappear in the applicant waiting room.</p>\nScene 4: Pain Tolerance\n<p>The next trial focuses on the body&rsquo;s ability to endure pain. Each initiate is surrounded by six monks. One by one, the monks will strike, and the initiates must guess from where the attack comes.</p>\n<p>"Pain. It is the body&rsquo;s way of begging for mercy. But you will give it none... Strength lies in enduring the blows, in knowing that pain is but a fleeting guest. To survive, you must conquer it."&nbsp;Initiates must guess whether the attack comes from the front or the back.&nbsp;Six monks will attack in total. Guess correctly to endure the strike.&nbsp;Only Gerhart survives this trial.</p>\nScene 5: Strength of Will and Body\n<p>A massive tree stands before each initiate, representing an immovable challenge. The monks must break the tree using only their hands, channeling their energy and spirit to overcome the seemingly impossible task.</p>\n<p>"You will break this tree, or it will break you."&nbsp;Each initiate has five punches to destroy the tree. Failure results in broken hands.&nbsp;Gerhart alone succeeds in breaking the tree.</p>\nScene 6: Free-for-All Battle\n<p>The final trial is a battle to the death.

Dressed in the garb of guards, they escort Aarog&mdash;disguised as a prisoner&mdash;through the dimly lit corridors of the prison. The iron shackles clink against the cold stone, masking the tremor of their nerves. Tension crackles in the air as they approach the catacombs, the restless spirits within a ticking time bomb waiting to be unleashed.</p>\n<p>The ancient gate creaks open, groaning as if in protest. With a silent nod, they release the spirits, sending echoes of agony through the tunnels as the vengeful ghosts swarm forth, a chaotic force the party hopes will buy them precious time. The party presses on, their breaths shallow and eyes darting through the shadows. The air grows colder as they delve deeper into the prison, each step weighed down by the fragility of their deception.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 2: The Elemental Standoff</strong></p>\n<p>The party reaches the Elemental Containment Room. Before them roils the Fire Elemental, the prison&rsquo;s fiery core, caged within a lattice of arcane runes. They attempt to bluff their way past the guards, claiming they are here to relieve them on the Warden's orders. Suspicion flickers in the guards&rsquo; eyes, a heartbeat of silence hanging between truth and violence.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t last. Weapons are drawn, and the clash of steel reverberates through the chamber. In the chaos, Bandira freezes as the Ghost of Sameness, relentless in its hunt, slithers into the room from the catacombs. Its form, a grotesque mass of hatred and malice, moves with an eerie grace as it closes in on her. The party fights on, their strikes fueled by desperation as they fend off the guards while the ghost looms ever closer.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 3: Bargaining with Fire</strong></p>\n<p>With the guards finally defeated, the party turns to the raging Fire Elemental, its form crackling and flaring against the confines of its cage. They approach cautiously, struggling to communicate their intentions amidst the swirling heat and fury. Several attempts to reason with it fail, until at last, a tenuous understanding is reached.</p>\n<p>The Elemental hisses and roars, agreeing to grant them a head start before unleashing its wrath upon the prison. With hands trembling, they set the bomb and light the fuse, the faint hiss of burning cord adding urgency to their movements. They scramble toward the Warden&rsquo;s Passage, the room shaking as the explosion rips through the air behind them. A surge of fire fills the chamber, signaling the Elemental&rsquo;s rampage has begun, turning the prison into a blazing inferno.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 4: The Chains of Fear</strong></p>\n<p>Racing toward the tunnel leading to the surface, the party suddenly encounters the swirling mass of chains from the catacombs. Twisted metal and dark malevolence writhe before them, a nightmare given form. Sszardin, his resolve usually unbreakable, is struck with an inexplicable terror. The creature mirrors his fear, feeding on it, locking them both in a paralyzing standoff.</p>\n<p>In that moment of frozen fear, Q'an steps forward. He draws the entity's ire, becoming the focus of its frenzied rage. With a shriek of tearing metal, the chains lash out, shredding Q'an in an explosion of blood and steel. His sacrifice buys the party a fleeting chance, and they bolt into the now-exposed tunnel, hearts pounding with the realization of what they&rsquo;ve just lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 5: Betrayal in the Dark</strong></p>\n<p>Darkness surrounds them as they rush down the tunnel. Aarog suddenly stops and turns back to Sszardin, who is struggling to keep pace, clutching his wounded side from the earlier battles. In the dim light, Aarog&rsquo;s face twists into a sneer, his true intentions finally laid bare.</p>\n<p>\"Zilvra sends her regards,\" he says coldly, his voice dripping with malice. \"She hired me to deliver your corpse, nephew.\"</p>\n<p>Before Sszardin can react, Aarog fires a poisoned arrow. It embeds itself in Sszardin&rsquo;s chest, the venom spreading through his veins like icy tendrils. Sszardin collapses, betrayal burning deeper than the poison now coursing through his body. Without hesitation, Aarog stuffs the unconscious Sszardin into a haversack, his mission all but complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene 6: The Final Escape</strong></p>\n<p>With the prison behind them in chaos, the remaining party members push forward, their faces bloodied, their hearts hardened. The tunnel groans around them as they dash through its collapsing confines. They hear the detonation of the second bomb, a thunderous roar that seals the tunnel behind them, cutting off any potential pursuit and trapping the horrors of the prison within.</p>\n<p>Emerging into the harsh light of the surface, they collapse onto the rocky ground, gasping for breath. Bloodied and battered, they take in their surroundings&mdash;cold, vast, and unforgiving. Their escape is a bittersweet victory, tainted by the treachery that shattered their trust. The sun rises slowly, casting long shadows over the wasteland ahead, as they pick themselves up, facing a world forever changed by the events they left smoldering in the depths below.</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p>The scene shifts to the oppressive darkness of the prison as the heavy iron door groans open, allowing a thin, flickering light to cut through the murky gloom. Sszardin T&rsquo;Sarran is shoved into the cell, stumbling over the grimy stone floor. The stench of rot and decay assaults his senses as he catches himself, his eyes sweeping over the miserable confines. Behind him, the guards snicker, their faces twisted with satisfaction as they lock the cell, their laughter echoing ominously down the stone corridor.</p>\n<p>The cell is a squalid hole. The stone walls, slick with filth and dampness, bear the scars of countless years of neglect. Straw mats, stained and darkened, are strewn haphazardly across the floor, offering little comfort against the icy chill that permeates the air.</p>\n<p>Sszardin surveys his fellow prisoners in the dim light: a grizzled veteran with a face etched by years of battle, a wiry rogue whose eyes dart nervously around the cell, and a solemn cleric, muttering silent prayers to gods long forsaken. A surge of anger rises within Sszardin&mdash;an indomitable fire, even in the face of despair. He glares at the guards stationed outside, their armor emblazoned with the insignia of the ruling noble houses. Their eyes remain cold, indifferent to the suffering they inflict.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, one of the guards moves with surprising speed, drawing a knife and plunging it into his comrade&rsquo;s neck. The dying guard gurgles, eyes wide with shock as he collapses, a pool of blood spreading across the stone floor. The remaining guard steps forward, torchlight illuminating his face&mdash;a familiar face.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Q&rsquo;an Sorelin,&rdquo; he hisses, urgency in his voice. &ldquo;I served your mother as a spy.&rdquo; He glances back, his gaze scanning the shadows for any sign of witnesses. &ldquo;There is no safety left in the Underdark, not even for you. We have only moments. Behind the barracks is a tunnel leading to the surface, but a magical ward seals the prison. To escape, we need to destroy its source: a bound elemental. We&rsquo;ll have to use force, and the explosion will bring down the ward, freeing the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Q&rsquo;an thrusts a crumpled piece of parchment into Sszardin&rsquo;s hands. The map reveals the layout of the prison, marking the tunnel&rsquo;s location. &ldquo;We need to gather materials for two explosives,&rdquo; Q&rsquo;an explains, his voice a harsh whisper. &ldquo;One to shatter the elemental&rsquo;s binding, the other to collapse the tunnel behind us and prevent pursuit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The group, now grim and determined, follows Q&rsquo;an through the labyrinthine corridors. Their footsteps echo against the cold stone walls, and the air grows colder the deeper they descend. As they approach the inventory room, their path is suddenly blocked by a towering mechanical sentry. The construct&rsquo;s eyes blaze with an eerie, unnatural light as it issues a challenge in a grating monotone: &ldquo;Lie, and you will die by my hand. Tell the truth, and you will meet the same end.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sszardin narrows his eyes, weighing their options. Without a word, he gestures for a bypass, but the sentry springs to life, its limbs whirring with lethal intent. A fierce battle erupts, the corridor filled with the clash of steel and the flash of spells. The sentry fights with relentless precision, its metal limbs striking out with mechanical fury. The party, driven by desperation, fights back, focusing their strikes to disable the relentless guardian.</p>\n<p>After a grueling struggle, they finally bring the sentry crashing to the ground. Its limbs twitch once before falling still, the light in its eyes dimming to nothingness. The path clear, they push open the door to the inventory room, gasping for breath but their resolve unbroken. Shelves lined with vials, powders, and weapons greet them&mdash;the tools they need for their escape.</p>\n<p>As they begin gathering supplies, a tense silence descends. Their task is far from over; ahead lies the challenge of unbinding the elemental and breaking the prison&rsquo;s ward. Beyond that, the dark, uncertain tunnels to the surface await.</p>\n<p>With the gathered materials in hand, they continue to the confiscation vault, forcing open its heavy doors. Inside, an unexpected rage flares between Sszardin and Mikgrym, compelling them to attack each other with ferocity. Arcane energy crackles in the air as they exchange blows, but it soon becomes clear that the fury is not their own. Stepping outside the vault dissipates the anger, revealing the trap's true nature: the vault magnifies hostility, allowing only one person to enter at a time.</p>\n<p>Juts thgen they notice that the broken pieces of the guardian begin to moved toward one another, rebuilding itself. Quickly adjusting their plan, Mikgrym begins hurling items out of the vault while Sszardin shoves the Guardian&rsquo;s shattered remains back inside, buying them precious time. With a final heave, they slam the vault door shut, trapping the Guardian's head in the hallway and rendering it powerless to fully rebuild.</p>\n<p>Regrouping, they make their way to the storage room. Inside, shelves of forgotten items stretch into the darkness, thick with dust. After a tense search, they find the fuses needed for the bombs. But the spy who holds the key to the tunnel&rsquo;s navigation remains missing. Eavesdropping on nearby guards, they learn the spy was thrown into the catacombs, where darkness would break him or end him. The party knows they must descend into the depths.</p>\n<p>In the catacombs, they are greeted by a labyrinth of horrors. Dust chokes the air, relics of the past rust and crumble, and an oppressive silence bears down on them. As they move deeper, a ghostly figure materializes before them, whispering, &ldquo;Bonessssss&hellip;&rdquo; Bandira attempts to communicate, but the spirit advances, relentless and driven by centuries of torment. Bandira realizes that as long as she lives, the ghost will never cease its pursuit. Luckily, it moves incredibly slowly</p>\n<p>Pressing onward, they encounter other spirits&mdash;prisoners trapped in endless cycles of madness. Diplomacy fails, and a brutal battle erupts. Sszardin wields a sword recovered from the vault, its blade banishing the spirits with each swing, sending them to whatever awaits them beyond death.</p>\n<p>Deeper in the catacombs, they find the body of the spy. Clutched in his cold, lifeless hands is a map, indicating the tunnel they seek. As they prepare to leave, they glimpse a swirling mass of black chains in the shadows, an unseen presence observing them. Deciding not to provoke it, they turn away, their senses sharpened by the lurking danger, and head back to the upper levels.</p>\n<p>Their final objective leads them to the workshop. Within, a lone prisoner named Taskan hunches over a workbench, crafting an amulet with meticulous care. He eyes the party warily and demands their intentions. Their attempts at deception falter, prompting Taskan to move for the exit. In a flurry of action, they subdue him, pinning him against the wall. They confiscate the amulet he was working on, uncertain of its power but unwilling to leave it behind.</p>\n<p>With time running short, they head to the armory, a fortress guarded by two sentries. Crafting a ruse, they convince the guards their shift is over and that they are the replacements. To their astonishment, the plan works, granting them access to the armory&rsquo;s stores. However, an aura of peace permeates the room, robbing them of the will to fight. They gather the black powder and retreat to the prison cells.</p>\n<p>Q&rsquo;an begins crafting the bombs, his hands moving deftly despite the tension. Twice he fails, filling the room with smoke and small explosions. But on the third and forth attempt, he succeeds, producing two volatile explosives. The party now faces a critical decision: how best to deploy the bombs to ensure their escape.</p>\n<p>With every path fraught with danger, Sszardin and his companions know that their next steps will determine not only their fate but possibly set the stage for a greater reckoning in the dark, treacherous world beyond the prison walls.</p>",

They fell for almost 2 days before the saw a feignt light rushing towards them, each one realizing a the last moment that it was a large patch of biolumunicesent fungi. None of them know how they survived the impact, but they seemed relatively unharmed despite being a little sore, and thirsty.</p>\n<p>They are in a large, open cavern with rough, uneven ground. Broken equipment and remnants of previous adventurers are scattered around. The darkness down here is total, almost magical. The group sees as a small glowing centipede rises from one of the cracks in one of the rocks, when immediately following a slightly glowing moth with a 5 foot wingspan swoops in and devours the centipede.</p>\n<p>If the players try to create a magical light, the moths will devour it. The moths will not approach fire, so it is a safe source of light.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the players get settled, a torch goes out suddenly, and a player feels a cold hand on their shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Initial Encounter: Detailed Breakdown</h3>\n<h4><strong>Event Trigger</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sudden Darkness</strong>: Without warning, the torches go out, plunging the area into complete darkness. Describe the sudden chill and the oppressive silence that follows.</li>\n<li><strong>The Hand</strong>: One player feels a cold, clammy hand on their shoulder, accompanied by a sense of dread and a faint whispering sound.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Reaction</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Panic and Confusion</strong>: The players scramble to relight their torches. Emphasize the urgency and fear in their actions, with trembling hands and hastily fumbled equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Lighting the Torch</strong>: When a torch finally ignites, it reveals a grisly sight at their feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Revealing the Duergar</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Describe the Duergar in detail: a small, grey-skinned dwarf-like creature, covered in blood and lying in a pool of it. His breathing is labored, and his eyes are wide with terror.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Words</strong>: As the players gather around, the Duergar coughs weakly and utters, \"Stay in the light...\" before expiring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Aftermath</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigating the Body</strong>: The players might want to check the Duergar for clues. His wounds suggest a brutal attack, but there's no immediate sign of what caused them.</li>\n<li><strong>The Warning</strong>: The Duergar's final words set the tone for the session, emphasizing the importance of light and the lurking danger in the darkness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Building Tension</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lingering Fear</strong>: The players are now acutely aware of the presence of 'The Unknown.' Every flicker of their torches and every shadow becomes a potential threat.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Hints</strong>: Use subtle environmental cues to maintain tension. Strange sounds, brief glimpses of movement in the dark, and the occasional dimming of torches keep the players on edge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Narrative Impact</h3>\n<p>This initial encounter sets the stage for the entire session, establishing the core threat of 'The Unknown' and the critical importance of staying in the light. It creates immediate tension and fear, ensuring the players are constantly on guard and aware of the dangers that lurk in the darkness.</p>\n<h1><strong>Act 2: Ongoing Threat</strong></h1>\n<p>At this point the players can do what they wish. Explore the pit, stay put, whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the session, 'The Unknown' remains an ever-present danger. Light sources flicker and dim, strange whispers fill the air, and the players feel its eyes on them at all times.<br><br>Whenever they enter darkness or rest, 'The Unknown' uses Drain Essence.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Darkness</strong>: Certain puzzles or paths require the players to extinguish their lights to proceed. Perhaps glowing symbols or paths only appear in complete darkness, guiding them to the next section.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Hazards</strong>: Strong drafts of wind or sudden gusts from hidden vents can extinguish torches unexpectedly. The pit may also have sections with high humidity or sudden water flows that douse flames.</p>\n<p><strong>Hostile Creatures</strong>: Certain creatures in the pit are attracted to light and will actively try to snuff it out. These creatures could be insects or small predators that swarm and attack light sources, making it difficult to keep them lit.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychological Manipulation</strong>: 'The Unknown' can create illusions or manipulate the players' senses, making them think their light sources are extinguished or leading them into areas of darkness through fear and hallucinations.</p>\n<h1><strong>Act 3: Climactic Confrontation</strong></h1>\n<p>The final encounter with 'The Unknown' should be a desperate struggle to maintain light and fend off the creature. The players must use their wits and remaining resources to survive, with the constant threat of 'The Unknown' extinguishing their light and consuming them.</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p>Matron Elvath, Lareth, and Rizzen T&rsquo;sarran awoke disoriented, their bodies aching but miraculously intact. They had plummeted for what felt like an eternity&mdash;almost two days&mdash;through an endless abyss before being greeted by a faint glow rushing up to meet them. At the last moment, they saw what had saved them: a massive patch of bioluminescent fungi, its spongy surface breaking their fall. As they lay sprawled on the uneven ground, they exchanged bewildered glances. How had they survived? They were bruised and parched, but remarkably unharmed given the magnitude of their descent.</p>\n<p>The cavern around them was vast, its floor uneven and treacherous. Remnants of broken weapons, torn packs, and skeletal remains scattered the area, remnants of previous explorers who had met their end in this unforgiving expanse. The darkness was absolute, oppressive, and unnaturally dense&mdash;as though it held a life of its own. It pressed in around them, swallowing all but the faintest of glows from the fungi that dotted the distant rock faces.</p>\n<p>A small, luminous centipede skittered out from a crack in the stone nearby, its body casting a faint blue light as it crawled over the rocks. Elvath and her kin watched, fascinated, but their curiosity was short-lived. From the shadows above, a moth with wings spanning nearly five feet swooped down, devouring the centipede in a single, fluid motion. The glow of the centipede vanished within the moth&rsquo;s maw, leaving behind only darkness.</p>\n<p>Wary of the strange creatures, the group conjured a magical light to illuminate their path. Yet as the light floated ahead, the air filled with the beating of wings, and several moths converged upon it, consuming the light entirely. The party exchanged a silent, grim understanding&mdash;they would need to navigate this treacherous cavern in darkness to avoid attracting the attention of the moths.</p>\n<p>With cautious steps, they continued onward, moving through the pitch-black cavern until they stumbled upon the sound of gently trickling water. They carefully waded through, discovering the water to be shallow but chilling, each splash echoing unnervingly through the void around them. The sound seemed to amplify the silence, raising the tension as they moved deeper into the unknown.</p>\n<p>Without warning, hurried splashes broke the quiet&mdash;a frenzied rhythm of footsteps charging toward them. Startled, they summoned a faint light. The glow revealed a bloodied and battered elf rushing toward them, his eyes wild with terror. He lunged forward, clutching Lareth&rsquo;s shoulder before collapsing to the ground, gasping for breath. As they knelt beside him, his final, rasping words chilled them to the bone: &ldquo;...stay in the light.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Silence fell as the party absorbed his cryptic warning. What could he have meant? They exchanged nervous glances, tension hanging heavy in the air. Before they could make sense of it, more splashing footsteps echoed from the darkness. Weapons drawn, they braced for another confrontation. But instead of a monster, a young half-elf emerged, his face twisted in alarm as he stumbled toward them.</p>\n<p>After a tense exchange, the half-elf introduced himself as Carl. With cautious words and a pleading tone, he convinced the T&rsquo;Sarran trio that he was not the elf&rsquo;s murderer. In fact, Carl claimed to have lived in the cavern for months, scavenging supplies from the bodies of the fallen and avoiding the creatures lurking in the dark. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place of relative safety not far from here,&rdquo; he offered, his eyes darting around nervously. &ldquo;But we need to move quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With few options, the party decided to follow Carl. He warned them that the journey would take them through four perilous areas before they reached the shelter. As they traversed the first&mdash;the maze-like cavern&mdash;they agreed to move in darkness, unwilling to risk the light and the moths it attracted. The path twisted and turned, each passage looking as foreboding as the last. They moved in silence, every step echoing ominously around them.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they came upon a vast pool of water. Its surface was eerily still, reflecting only the faint bioluminescence of the fungi clinging to the cavern walls. The party began to cautiously skirt around the edge of the pool when a soft clicking echoed from the darkness. They froze, straining to listen as the clicks grew louder, multiplying and closing in on them.</p>\n<p>A sudden lunge from the shadows shattered the silence. In a blur of motion, a figure attacked, revealing itself under the dim glow of the fungi necklaces it wore. The creature was humanoid but distorted&mdash;its limbs unnervingly long, its skin gleaming like a mirror, reflecting the darkness around it. Its eyes were voids, black and soulless, and its movements were disturbingly silent, save for the rhythmic clicking that seemed to reverberate from its very bones.</p>\n<p>Two of the creatures materialized before the group, their bioluminescent necklaces casting a sickly glow as they prepared to attack. The party drew their weapons, and a fierce battle ensued. Steel clashed against elongated limbs, and dark magic crackled in the air. As the fight raged on, Lareth felt an unsettling sensation wash over her. She glanced around, confusion clouding her expression as an unexplainable weakness gripped her body. Every motion felt sluggish, her strength inexplicably drained.</p>\n<p>The lights faltered momentarily, plunging them into darkness. Rizzen felt a tap on his shoulder, a touch cold as death. The lights flickered back, and he staggered, gasping as a wave of fatigue coursed through him. Bewildered, they fought on, but with every resurgence of darkness came another tap, another drain of their vitality. It was as if something was feeding on their strength, striking from the shadows before slipping back into the void.</p>\n<p>The battle dragged on, their movements slowing, breaths coming in ragged gasps as they fended off the relentless assault of the mirror-skinned monsters. As they fought on, the echo of the dying elf's words haunted them: &ldquo;...stay in the light.&rdquo; But now, the light seemed to come at a cost. What would be the price of their survival in this black abyss where light and darkness waged their own unseen war?</p>\n<p>Seeing an opportunity to escape, the party squeezed through a small cave entrance at the end of the cavern and found themselves in a narrow, stone hallway. Carl gestured ahead and said, &ldquo;I call this &lsquo;The Stone Maze.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like: a maze, and it&rsquo;s made of stone. But don&rsquo;t worry; all we need to do is go to the center and make a left. Not much of a maze, really.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They pressed forward, the twisting passageways around them dimly lit by faintly glowing fungi clinging to the walls. The journey through the maze was eerily quiet, the darkness swallowing their footsteps as they moved cautiously. When they approached the maze&rsquo;s center, they came face-to-face with an enormous creature: the Fungal Behemoth. Its form was a grotesque fusion of plant and animal, its bark-like skin covered with bioluminescent fungi that cast an unsettling glow in the oppressive darkness. Its limbs resembled a combination of muscular flesh and gnarled tree roots, and its eyes gleamed with an unnatural, animalistic intelligence.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get close. Don&rsquo;t look at them,&rdquo; Carl whispered urgently. He led the party in a wide arc around the creature, avoiding its attention. They were almost clear when Rizzen&rsquo;s foot caught on a loose stone, sending him tumbling to the ground. The sudden noise startled the behemoth, and it turned its head toward the group, letting out a guttural, earth-shaking growl. In one swift motion, it grasped a massive boulder, lifting it high above its head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Carl shouted as the creature hurled the boulder toward them. The party dove into a narrow tunnel just in time. The boulder crashed into the tunnel&rsquo;s entrance, lodging itself firmly in place and sealing off their only route of escape.</p>\n<p>They scrambled to their feet, dusting off debris and assessing their surroundings. Ahead, the tunnel opened into a vast chasm. The remains of a wooden bridge lay broken far below, half-submerged in a black, murky pool of water. Carl explained that the bridge had once spanned the chasm, but either the rumbling of the boulder or some other force had destroyed it.</p>\n<p>After some deliberation, they used a Mold Earth spell to anchor a rope on the far side of the chasm. One by one, they shimmied across, hearts pounding as they dangled precariously over the abyss. Despite a few close calls, they all made it to the other side, breathing a collective sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>The tunnel opened into a cavern filled with small stone islands surrounded by the same murky water they had seen below. The islands were connected by fragile, rickety bridges that creaked ominously under their weight. In the distance loomed an old wooden structure.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been able to rest safely,&rdquo; Carl said, his voice strained with anxiety.</p>\n<p>They began to cross the islands, hopping cautiously from one to the next. Yet, as they progressed, an inexplicable fear washed over them. Rizzen and Lareth suddenly froze, their eyes wide with terror. An ominous presence seemed to loom over the group, as if unseen eyes were watching their every move.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We need to keep going,&rdquo; Carl urged, his voice breaking the spell of fear that had gripped them. With great effort, they continued, making their way to the structure. Just as they were about to reach it, the world around them blurred, and they found themselves standing at the chamber's entrance once more.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&hellip; what just happened?&rdquo; Lareth gasped, dropping to the ground, overwhelmed by dread. Her heart pounded in her chest, and she struggled to breathe as an unseen force squeezed at her mind.</p>\n<p>Before they could gather their thoughts, shadowy figures materialized around them. The figures were shrouded in tattered, ethereal robes that seemed to flicker in and out of existence. Their skeletal hands radiated an icy chill, and beneath their hoods glowed two malevolent eyes that burned with an unsettling intelligence.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve trapped us in an illusion,&rdquo; Carl muttered through gritted teeth. &ldquo;We never left this spot!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The party readied their weapons and spells, preparing to fight the spectral entities. As they summoned magical light to banish the darkness, a new problem arose. From above, Gloomwing moths swooped down, drawn to the light. When struck down, they exploded in bursts of blinding light, only to leave behind clouds of clinging darkness that deepened the shadows around them.</p>\n<p>As each burst of light faded, one of the party members would feel a tap on their shoulder, followed by a wave of weakness that sapped their strength. They quickly realized this was the same chilling sensation they had felt earlier in the cavern. Their unseen stalker was still among them.</p>\n<p>Carl, having been weakened by the sensation before, braced himself. The next time he felt the tap, he swung his weapon in the direction of the touch. When the lights returned, he found himself standing over a bloodied Rizzen, who had been wounded by his strike. Yet, from Rizzen&rsquo;s crumpled form, a dark, swirling cloud poured out. The shadowy mass coalesced into an amorphous shape, its smoky tendrils writhing with a malevolent life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been inside us,&rdquo; Lareth realized, her eyes widening in horror. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s feeding on our memories.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The entity hovered before them, shifting restlessly as if undecided on its next move. When exposed to their magical light, its form became semi-solid, revealing its vulnerability. The party sprang into action, focusing their attacks on the creature. The darkness around them churned as they fought, the Whispering Shroud minions flickering in and out of existence, their haunting presence pressing against the edges of the party&rsquo;s sanity.</p>\n<p>With each strike against the smoky form, the creature howled in a guttural voice, lashing out with tendrils of darkness. It took every ounce of the party&rsquo;s strength and coordination to keep it at bay, each blow driving it back bit by bit. Finally, with a combined surge of magic and steel, they shattered the creature&rsquo;s form. It dissipated into a swirling mist before fading entirely, leaving behind nothing but the echo of a haunting wail.</p>\n<p>As the shadow creature vanished, the Whispering Shroud minions flickered, losing their ethereal grip on the cavern until they, too, dissipated into shadow. The party stood in silence, their breaths ragged, their bodies weary from the battle.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&hellip; we did it,&rdquo; Carl panted, his eyes scanning the cavern warily.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elvath nodded, though her expression remained grim. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not out of this yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With the immediate threat vanquished, they made their way to the wooden structure. Inside, they found a small, dusty space that offered a semblance of safety. They bolted the door, set wards around the perimeter, and collapsed onto the floor, exhaustion weighing heavily on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest here,&rdquo; Elvath declared, her voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;We need to figure out what to do next.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As they settled into a fitful rest, the darkness outside loomed ever-present, a silent reminder that they were still deep within the pit, far from salvation. Yet, for the first time in what felt like ages, they could breathe, if only for a moment.</p>",

Seated against one wall within the cell is a motley assortment of individuals. <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Standing guard at the entrance to the cell are two soldiers, clad in armor emblazoned with the insignia of one of the ruling noble houses. One of the guards snears, "Can\'t wait until morning when they execute him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">like a lowly commoner </span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">with the rest of them back there.

He explains the need to gather enough materials for two explosives.

The elemental cannot be freed by magical means, but the Drow did not consider plain brute force. We need to set off an explosive to free the elemental, which will cause chaos and bring down the ward and unlock all of the prison cells in the prison.

                    "session_report": '<p>The tale unfolds amid a night of chaos and ruin within the heart of the T&rsquo;Sarran family estate, a fortress of ebony stone and shimmering warded gates that had long stood as a symbol of their power in the treacherous city of Menzoberranzan. The grand halls, once adorned with tapestries depicting the glories of their ancestors, now burned in an infernal blaze, casting flickering shadows across the Matron&rsquo;s Throne Room. Acrid smoke curled through the air, mingling with the clash of steel and the hissing incantations of dark magic, as House T&rsquo;Sarran\'s final defenders were pushed to their limits.</p>\n<p>The air was thick with the scent of blood and charred stone as the last members of House T\'Sarran, encircled by their enemies&mdash;the allied forces of three rival Houses&mdash;fought with grim determination. Their eyes blazed with defiance, reflecting the roaring flames that consumed their home, but it was a doomed effort. Driders&mdash;grotesque abominations of half-drow, half-spider&mdash;skittered into the chamber, accompanied by the cold, merciless forms of Matron Mothers who wielded deadly magic with ease. Lightning crackled and shadows danced as spells were cast, each more deadly than the last.</p>\n<p>One by one, the defenders of House T&rsquo;Sarran fell, their cries lost amid the tumult. Their bodies were thrown mercilessly into the room&rsquo;s yawning central pit&mdash;a seemingly bottomless chasm that devoured them, leaving only darkness behind. It was a sacrifice to the void, a final offering to the ruthless cycle of power and blood that ruled the Underdark.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this chaos stood Zilvra, the younger sister of Matron Elvath, her face a mask of determination despite the terror gnawing at her insides. As she parried the strikes of a drider, a voice&mdash;cold and whispering, like a serpent&rsquo;s hiss&mdash;echoed in her mind: <em>"Stay your hand and live."</em> She hesitated, a shiver running down her spine. The compulsion was unnerving, and she faltered, her resolve shaken for the first time. Yet, the instinct to survive surged within her, battling against her desire to fight to the bitter end.</p>\n<p>With one last, desperate glance at the massacre around her, she turned to rejoin the fray, only to see Matron Elvath make a final, fateful stand. In a burst of fury, Elvath grappled with a rival Matron, the two of them tumbling into the bottomless pit, their screams swallowed by the darkness below. The sight left Zilvra reeling, her heart pounding in her chest as the last of her kin met their end.</p>\n<p><em>The voice returned,</em> louder and more insistent this time. <em>"Sit upon the throne and you will live."</em> Her legs moved of their own accord, carrying her to the Matron&rsquo;s Throne. She sank into it, her hands clutching the armrests as if they were her last tether to sanity. With a wild, haunted gaze, she watched as her remaining family members fell, one by one, until at last, silence settled over the room.</p>\n<p>The victorious Matrons approached her, their expressions hard and unyielding. "Lolth has decreed the fall of your House," one of them intoned, her voice dripping with cold authority. "You alone may rebuild, but the T&rsquo;Sarran name is no more. Betray us, seek vengeance, and Lolth will know. The punishment will be swift and merciless." Their words struck Zilvra like a dagger, each syllable a reminder of the fragile, perilous existence she now faced.

They share their confusion and unease before encountering a frantic injured elf who warns them to stay in the light. In the darkness, they face a series of threats including humanoid monsters and a powerful Fungal Behemoth, leading to a desperate escape across precarious islands.

The large demon knocks her down again as we take out the second Nabassu.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The water elemental and the final stone golem turn on each other and we try to stay out of the way. Lucy plays a game of Keep Away with the death wraith for almost the entire battle before smiting it down at the end.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Nym bounds in toward the large demon and hits him with a Stunning Strike, allowing others to pile on damage.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Retta gets to her feet and in her only effetcive move of the entire battle, rips the large demon up from nutsack to sternum and he drops dead to the ground. As he does, we feel the ground begin to shake and Zen notices that the lava below is starting to rise.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>The Ground and the Vanguard Begin to Break Up</h3>\nRealizing we&rsquo;re short on time, we quickly loot the bodies because there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>always</em> time for looting. Sszarden takes a necklace from the Nabassu and realizes it&rsquo;s what was letting them control the stone golems. Garus cuts the horn off the NightWalker&rsquo;s head as a trophy and finds a white Robe of the Archmagi which he gives to Retta. We also quickly stuff 400 lbs of platinum into our bags of holding.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Sszarden unlocks Nicodemus&rsquo; cage and Retta immediately runs to his side.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Knowing he can&rsquo;t teleport back to the material plane with them, Retta decides to cast her lot with her old friend Nicodemus. We give her a sending stone, telling her to keep in touch. She casts dimension door, nutshots Sszarden one last time, and disappears with Nicodemus. They land just outside of the castle and see the caldera bubbling as the lava rises.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Running up the foothills of the caldera, they make their escape.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Nym runs over to the girl who he finally recognizes as Sachia, and convinces her that she&rsquo;s safe but they need to go now. Lucy uses the cubic gate to cast the Gate spell and we walk through to the first floor of the Shimmering Elm Library back in Tetbury.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Catching Up in the Library</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Asking an avowed for the way to Yaldra&rsquo;s office, we burst in and she&rsquo;s both surprised and concerned to see us. We quickly fill her in on the details of our adventure into the Shadowfell. Realizing there&rsquo;s still a portal on this plane, Mithac pulls out the Amulet of the Planes Compass and we see it glowing in the direction of Gasalton. Remembering that this was where the mining camp was, we realize that our elderly couple must have perished in the caves before destroying the portal.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We hope that Retta and Nicodemus are eventually able to finish destroying the Altherstab portal in the Shadowfell.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Yaldra calls an attendant to come see to Sachia and take her away somewhere safe. She informs us of the developments in Coia since we&rsquo;ve been gone. Our disruption of Soren Lorenson and the Red Cloaks up in Aveton has created a vacuum of power which Lord Mangdarroth has been filling by conscripting citizens and sending troops around Coia.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Trying to soften his image, he had sent Sachia to Gasalton on a goodwill tour and that&rsquo;s where she was captured by Mephisto&rsquo;s forces just like the other local farmers there.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>She warns us that we are wanted in Coia and reminds us to trust no one. Lord Geddy Lee has also been acting dictatorily lately as he attempts to amass more power himself. She offers to get the Rod of Rulership back to Coia to give us some breathing room, but recommends we lay low for a few months until the heat dies down.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Garus decides he&rsquo;s had enough of this realm and heads back towards the spot where he came into this plane. Staying under the cover of his invisibility cloak, he finds his way back to his portal and walks back through to try to prove himself to his tribe.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Lucy suggests that the rest of us hide out in the tree as we&rsquo;ll still be able to adventure and do some good while laying low. Mithac, Zen, and Nym eagerly agree, and Sszarden eventually comes around to the idea. Yaldra wants us out of her library, so she gives us a teleportation scroll and we teleport ourselves back to Gerhart&rsquo;s barn, only to find ourselves staring face to face with a big pig.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Epilogue</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Gerhart gives us a warm greeting and relays his tale of the past week. He had seen smoke coming out of the cave-in and gone over to investigate. There he had found Flynn crying over the body of Beth Ann. As we step out of the caravan, we realize we&rsquo;re back at the mining camp in Gasalton as we see both Flynn and Beth Ann walking by with food and they greet us warmly. Good thing Gerhart is a helluva healer.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>We quickly find and smash the last portal to pieces and watch as the Amulet finally goes dark.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We send word to Yaldra that our quest is complete.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>It&rsquo;s been a long eight months for this weary group of adventurers and we&rsquo;re all looking forward to some rest. We remain helping out around the camp for a few days, and guide Flynn and Beth Ann back to their farm. When Lucy&rsquo;s tree finally arrives, our old friend Mooseknuckle greets us and invites us inside.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Each of the remaining members of the Dragonbone Vanguard bids a fond farewell to Gerhart, makes like a tree, and leaves.</div>',

In a fortunate turn of events, our entire group is able to line up around him ready to strike. Just as he awakens from his incapacitation our group unleashes hell on him before he had a chance to get away and we killed him. We moved his body back into the room he came from and took his +1 Slashing Knife.<br>&nbsp;<br>Zen opens a second door in the dining and scouts out the room ahead and sees another creature (an Allip) in long flowing robes floating before another dais, similar to what he saw in the first door. There are shallow steps leading up to a frame of polished stone that looks like a mirror, although the creature casts no reflection.<br>&nbsp;<br>Quietly creeping through the room, he sees a statue in the far corner that seems to be guarding the stairs up. He finds that this room connects with the room he saw from the first door. It&rsquo;s one large room where they appear to be holding people in cages on racks who are near death&rsquo;s door. The group forms a plan to take out the two creatures just as Mithac hears a dragging sound out in the hallway.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, in other parts of the castle&hellip;<br>&nbsp;<br>Garus continues looking around the large room he&rsquo;s in. He sneaks over to the far door and finds another portal. The archway is smooth and there are tracks indicating it&rsquo;s been used recently, but it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be active right now. The tracks are a mix of humanoid and animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>He sneaks down a hallway that loops back around to the main gate. There are three doors across from the gate and a large status holding the doors of the gate shut. Sneaking back down the initial hallway he came in, he finally gets close enough to the group that Retta&rsquo;s message and she instructs him to come through the crack and joins them in the dining room.<br>&nbsp;<br>All together now&hellip;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sszarden slams a table down in the dining room to cause the first Allip to float our way. Once it gets through the door, we attack en masse and Mithac lops its head off. We find an obsidian emblem on a chain worth 125G. Examining the dais, Retta determines that it&rsquo;s used as a scry. Zen notices that the statue guarding the stairs seems to have changed its position.<br>&nbsp;<br>We quickly kill the second Allip and note the poor state of the prisoners. Sszarden puts one of them out of its misery and Retta spends some time interrogating the newly deceased, pretty much to no avail.<br>&nbsp;<br>We head back toward the status only to find it staring right at us. It attacks and after a rather quick battle, we destroy it. Heading up the stairs, we come across a small room with doors to the front, left, and right. There&rsquo;s nothing in the room except a small brazier with some bloodstains, and a pile of ash in the corner.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we enter each room, we can hear what sounds like lava flowing behind the walls. This sound always seems to stop once a door is opened. After some experimentation, a drop of Zen&rsquo;s blood opens the front door, a drop of water opens the left, and bit of dust opens the right. We proceed forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the next room we again see three doors, this time with a small table in the middle with a scale on it. A large red diamond is on one side of the scale. Again some experimenting, Zen&rsquo;s hands on the other side open the right door, gold on the other side opens the left door. Looking through these doors, we see the same setup of doors and scales and figure our best bet tis ti continue down the path we&rsquo;re on. After moving the diamond. a crash of lighting passes through the room. Garus runs downstairs and cuts the heart out of a prisoner below and brings it back up to place on the scale. The middle door opens and we proceed forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>The next room has three doors with plaques above each. The left one reads &ldquo;Death&rdquo;, the right one is blank, and the forward one reads &ldquo;Death&rdquo; in Abyssal. Garus runs back downstairs to grab another prisoner in case we need a death.

Another Sorrowsworn is standing in front&nbsp;of a 7th portal! Whaaaa???</div>\n<div>We make short work of the sorrowsworn as we blast it apart, with Mithac chopping off its crystal penis in a most insulting death blow.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Still reeling&nbsp;from the discovery of another portal, Nym hears a familiar voice calling him in his head. Yaldra&nbsp;tells him that she\'s done some research into Mephisto and found that he is a Nightwalker, a sentient undead monster, both death and shadow. He\'s immune to non-magical damage and only communicates telepathically. She suggests that we guard our minds. Nym relays this information to the group.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Where Lucy had been standing, a large tree suddenly&nbsp;appears.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Lucy finds his old friend Moose who has been busy on his own mission and inquires how Lucy is doing. Moose pulls out a haversack and tells Lucy that someone wanted our group to have this. Lucy thanks him and they wish each other luck as the tree disappears. Inside the haversack, Lucy distributes notes for Garus and Mithac, an hourglass of recall (once per day you can undo the last turn) for Zen, 2 elemental gems for Szarden, a mind-piercing bow and mithral armor for Lucy, and mask of the Gods to Nym.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Retta says that Nicodemus told her there\'s another portal inside the castle. We notice that this portal appears to be more active than the one on the left, noting that it looks like something&nbsp;has recently been dragged through. We feel a slight tremor and quickly bust up both of these portals.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Realizing that we really didn\'t know the total number of portals, we check the compass and see that it is glowing faintly in the western direction. Nuts. Deciding that it\'ll be quicker to travel to Shadowfell and start destroying the portals from that side, we activate the cubic gate and cast Plane Shift to find ourselves in the Shadowfell&nbsp;outside of the Upper Lachis portal which we quickly smash.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Back in Shadowfell</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Rasputin scouts ahead and sees 2 patrols circling counter-clockwise. Jumping in between them and keeping our distance from both, we circle over to the Wiggam portal. It\'s mossy on this side and the portal looks to be dead, same as we\'d found it on the material plane. We smash it anyway for good measure and continue on.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Nym decides to try to contact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/borivik-seshani-person">Borivik Seshani</a> once more and is finally successful! Borivik is disturbed to find out that he\'s now a resident of the ring. He doesn\'t have any more information about the portals unfortunately.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>While Nym talks to the voices in his head again, Retta catches up with Szsarden and tells him that her research found that his family had been caught in a war between Hellestra and Lolth.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We approach a familiar looking portal in a rocky area with no vegetation. It\'s high up a set of stairs and&nbsp; we fear that it\'s so out in the open and close to the castle, destroying it may bring unwanted attention our way. Noticing the cages on the side, we realize that this was the portal in Altherstab, the very first one we\'d come across. Knowing it to already be inactive on the material plane, we decide to reverse course and sweep around the other side, ambushing the last 2 patrols of Death Knights along the way.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Approaching the Herthe portal, we realize we\'re pretty close to the other side of the castle and want to destroy it quietly so we let Retta eldritch blast it. She blasted at the base, at the base; no trouble.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Into the Castle</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Sneaking mostly stealthily up to the castle, Szarden picks the lock on the first gate. Zen and Garus go invisible and take point. Entering the castle, we find it to be stiflingly hot with heat rising up from grates in the floor, moaning and screaming sounds blending&nbsp;in with the movement of molten rock sounds to create a very unpleasant atmosphere.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Picking the lock on a second gate, we find a corridor. As Zen heads to the left and Garus heads to the right, Retta messages them both to stay in contact. Garus hears movement ahead of him and notices a large creature that seems to be patrolling the corridor. He follows it down to the main entrance. As it&nbsp;reverses course on patrol, he ducks into the shadows and watches it go by, noticing it\'s some orc-like creature. Informing the others of this, he continues to the main room, falling out of range of the message spell. Seeing something large blocking the main doors of the caselt, he turns to his left to find a hallway leading into a large open space.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The clearing he finds is about 150 ft wide and 120 ft deep and open to the sky above. There are metal doors around the perimeter and 4 grates in the floor with devices hanging above them (some with creatures inside). There\'s noticeably little movement in the room, although he spies some tables with three tall creatures with chains and hooks standing&nbsp;near them. This doesn\'t look good.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Meanwhile Zen finds a door at the end of his corridor and a crack in the wall that it looks like he can squeeze through. He tries the doorknob and while super-squeaky, it appears to be unlocked. Fearing drawing attention to himself by opening it, he squeezes through the crack in the wall to find himself in what appears to be an empty dining room with still-warm plates left on the tables. Opening the door to the next room, he sees a stone dais next to a tall cloaked figure wearing a long, pointed hood. He messages that this way is clear and the rest of the group follow. Most of the group gets through the crack in the wall but Retta and Mithac bump into each other and create enough noise to raise an alert. The creaky door opens to reveal a large figure with the body of a man but the head of a rooster, carrying a large sickle. Roostertaur takes a swipe at Retta just as she jumps through the crack.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Looks like we\'re gonna be making some omelets tonight...</div>\n<div id="f7ce4e08ff8ad6e71fd6652ddd509cb8" class="visibility-toggler d-block">\n<div class="section-payload">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>',

One guard, <em>Merrick Amberdon</em>, agreed to let them through and escorted them back to the library, where <em>Lucy</em> flipped him a silver coin in thanks. On the way, they noticed a couple of elegantly dressed ladies leaving the library.</p>\n<p>Once inside, they handed over the Fey ashes to <em>Stephan</em>. Pleased with the progress but a bit distracted, Stephan explained he&rsquo;d spilled some <em>Plane Rice</em> earlier, which his kleptomaniac pet hamsters (<em>Jonathon, Neil, Steve, and Arnel</em>) had taken away. To make the <em>Amulet of the Planes</em> work, he needed the rice back. The group agreed to take shrinking potions to recover the rice, with <em>Garus, Lucy, Nym, Retta, and Zen</em> shrinking to one-tenth their normal size. <em>Mithac</em> and <em>Sszarden</em> opted to stay full-sized. Unfortunately, <em>Retta</em> drank two potions and shrunk to one-hundredth of her normal size, so <em>Zen</em> placed her on his shoulder as they headed through a hamster hole in the wall.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hamster Heist</strong></p>\n<p>Once inside the hamster tunnels, the group split up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Garus</em> turned invisible and went left, eventually encountering a furry creature in a marshy area. Communicating via <em>Talk with Animals</em>, he tried to coax it into returning the Plane Rice by offering treats. Unsuccessful, he moved on, rejoining the others at the end of the hallway.</li>\n<li><em>Zen</em> flew down the right tunnel with Retta, encountering three hamsters. He also used <em>Speak with Animals</em> and negotiated with the hamsters, learning they enjoyed &ldquo;wacky tobbacky.&rdquo; He signaled to the rest of the group as they headed toward the tunnel's end.</li>\n<li><em>Lucy</em> and <em>Nym</em> continued straight and found a sack tied up. Nym fumbled with it, while Lucy calmly cut the rope with his knife. Inside was a ragged, magical stuffed animal, which they decided to investigate later. They joined the others at the end of the hallway, where three chests awaited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hamsters eventually revealed some grains of rice, starting with four grains from the right chest. Retta, dropped onto the middle chest by Zen, found a tooth necklace inside. After further negotiation, the hamsters opened the left chest, revealing two more grains. As the hamsters got increasingly excited, mocking <em>Zen&rsquo;s</em> southern accent and showing their sharp teeth, <em>Lucy</em> played music to calm them.</p>\n<p>The hamsters agreed to part with all the rice, provided the group fed their entire family. Suddenly, about a dozen more hamsters appeared from the tunnels, surrounding the party. Satisfied with the deal, the group began to gather the grains of rice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Garus</em> grabbed the sack they&rsquo;d found earlier,</li>\n<li><em>Nym</em> and <em>Lucy</em> collected two grains each, and</li>\n<li><em>Zen</em>, wearing the tooth necklace with Retta still attached, collected the final two grains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After exiting the tunnel, they convinced Stephan to feed the hamsters before returning to normal size (causing the rice grains to super-size). The group inquired about the items they had found. Stephan identified the <em>tooth necklace</em> as <em>Tisdor&rsquo;s Spare Tooth</em>, which granted extra necrotic damage when used for biting. The stuffed animal, a dangerous artifact called <em>Marble Eye</em>, was something Stephan refused to touch due to its potential to cause lasting harm. They also found a <em>Ring of Regeneration</em>, which <em>Garus</em> immediately claimed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Amulet of the Planes</strong></p>\n<p>Stephan used the last of his shrinking potion to return one grain of rice to its normal size, dropping it through the center of the amulet. The rice disappeared and the amulet began to glow, indicating that it would now act as a homing beacon for the final portal to the <em>Shadowfell</em>, growing brighter the closer they got to the portal. Stephan wished them luck and bid them goodnight.</p>\n<p><strong>Night at the Elegant Harpy</strong></p>\n<p>The group headed into town and stopped at the <em>Elegant Harpy</em> for the night. There, <em>Lucy</em> spotted the two elegant ladies they had seen earlier leaving the library and decided to serenade them. As he interacted with them, he noticed that they seemed unnaturally young and had a magical aura, suspecting they might be wizards or sorcerers. After some pleasant small talk, the ladies retired for the evening, leaving Lucy suspicious but intrigued.</p>\n<p>Feeling inspired, <em>Nym</em> made another attempt to contact <em>Borovic</em>, but once again failed spectacularly.</p>\n<p><strong>The Search for the Portal</strong></p>\n<p>The next morning, they checked the amulet, which indicated the portal was located in the <em>Berland region</em>. Using a teleportation scroll, they safely arrived at <em>Gerhardt&rsquo;s barn</em>, where they were warmly welcomed. After a brief explanation of recent events, <em>Gerhardt</em> retrieved the <em>Cubic Gate</em>, explaining its use as both a <em>Gate</em> spell and a <em>Plane Shift</em> tool.</p>\n<p>After some discussion, the group decided to use the amulet to locate and destroy the portal on the material plane to block access from the Shadowfell. Teleporting to <em>Berland</em>, they landed outside a small village. A local informed them they were in <em>Redcham</em>, and the amulet's glowing compass pointed toward <em>Exningdon</em>. Hoping they were close, they hired horses and set off toward their next destination.</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p><strong>Back at the Illuminated Meadow Library</strong></p>\n<p>While waiting for <em>Stephan</em> to return from his cottage, the group wandered around the library, admiring the towering bookshelves and intricate mosaic ceiling. Impatience got the best of <em>Nym</em>, who went to check on Stephan. Stephan mentioned that he had an idea for detecting where the portals would appear and thought he could create a homing device. He asked Nym if, by chance, he had an <em>Amulet of the Planes</em>. Nym recalled that they had come across one at some point and told Stephan to wait while he checked with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p><em>Lucy</em> remembered that <em>Gerhardt</em> had mentioned the amulet was broken, and they had given it to <em>Diothenes Jug</em> before sending him back to <em>Candlekeep</em>. Hoping to catch <em>Retta</em> before she left Candlekeep, Nym contacted <em>Yaldra</em> using a sending stone.</p>\n<p><strong>Meanwhile at Candlekeep</strong></p>\n<p>At Candlekeep, <em>Yaldra</em> was questioning Retta about what she knew of the demon <em>Mephisto</em>. Retta had little information, so Yaldra cast an incantation, opening a portal in front of them. She stepped through, and Retta followed, finding herself in the <em>Candlekeep Arboretum</em>, surrounded by a series of portals along a stone walkway. Yaldra directed Retta to a portal that would take her to <em>Upper Lachis</em> to rejoin her friends. Just as Retta stepped through, Yaldra received Nym's message through the sending stone but shrugged and continued on her way.</p>\n<p><strong>Retta&rsquo;s Return and Shopping Spree</strong></p>\n<p>Back at the library, Retta appeared almost immediately after Nym's realization. She came bearing 3000 platinum pieces for each member of the group, a reward from Yaldra for destroying three portals since their last meeting. After catching up with <em>Mithac</em> and sharing what she learned from <em>Nicodemus</em>, the group realized that there was a sixth portal. One side was located inside the castle in the <em>Shadowfell</em>, but the location on the material plane remained unknown.</p>\n<p>Flush with cash and eager to get the homing beacon built, the group decided to shop for goods and teleportation spells before setting off. They stocked up on various magical items and bling, preparing for their next steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Back to Candlekeep</strong></p>\n<p><em>Retta</em> cast a teleportation spell, and the group walked through a portal, finding themselves back in the <em>Candlekeep Arboretum</em>. Since this wasn't the standard method of entry, guards quickly surrounded them, but Retta's mention of their connection to <em>Diothenes Jug</em> calmed them down. One guard led them to Diophenes' office, where they found him looking a little worse for wear. <em>Mithac</em> didn't even recognize her long-time tutor at first, but he recognized her, and when they asked for the <em>Amulet of the Planes</em>, he handed it over.</p>\n<p>When asked about <em>Mephisto</em>, Diothenes claimed to know nothing but suggested that <em>Burko Darcy</em> might have some insights. After searching for Darcy, they were told he was away on business and wouldn't be back for some time. Disappointed, the group decided to return to the library.</p>\n<p><strong>Back to the Library Again</strong></p>\n<p>Returning to the library, <em>Stephan</em> was excited to see the <em>Amulet of the Planes</em> and immediately began working on the homing device. A short time later, he informed them that he needed a few more items to complete it. Since the group wanted to travel to the <em>Shadowfell</em>, Stephan required something from there. Fortunately, Lucy had collected some rocks from their journey, which he handed over to Stephan.</p>\n<p>Stephan then explained that he also needed a \"pound of ashes\" from creatures of the <em>Unseely Court</em> of the <em>Feywild</em>, as these would embody the chaos and destruction necessary for the homing device. After some initial confusion (Stephan originally said he needed to \"pound the asses\" of Fey creatures), the group understood what he meant.</p>\n<p>Reports of strange disturbances at the local lumberyard suggested that Fey creatures might be teleporting into the material plane. With no other leads, the group decided to investigate.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lumber Mill Battle</strong></p>\n<p>Heading north, the group followed the river about a quarter-mile upstream to a lumber mill. The half-orc owner, <em>Therogar</em>, was just closing up for the evening and explained how recent mischief had been plaguing his mill. Hearing strange noises, the group looked around and saw a pile of lumber fall into the water. Noticing some very fast scurrying creatures, they took positions around the mill. After a brief but intense skirmish, they managed to kill eight <em>Quicklings</em>.</p>\n<p>Reviving one of the Quicklings, they attempted to interrogate it about where it had come from, but they didn&rsquo;t have much luck in finding a portal. With their priorities set on the homing device, they burned the Quickling bodies and collected the ashes to bring back to Stephan.</p>\n<p>The Vanguard was one step closer to building the device they needed to track and destroy the remaining portals, but more challenges undoubtedly awaited them as they prepared to confront whatever dark force was behind these disruptions.</p>",

While investigating the pool, a <em>Magmin</em> suddenly emerged from the portal, but the group quickly dispatched it and began the process of destroying the portal. As <em>Nym</em> and <em>Garus</em> struck the portal, the moss around it stirred, revealing several glowing eyes. The group realized too late that the moss itself was an <em>Alkilith</em>, a monstrous creature that surrounded the portal and attacked, attempting to inflict madness upon them.</p>\n<p>Amid the chaos, a <em>Death Knight</em> charged through the portal, unleashing a devastating fireball that knocked out both <em>Mithac</em> and the <em>Alkilith</em>. However, Nym managed to stun the Death Knight, allowing the rest of the group to finish it off. With the portal destroyed, they turned their attention to finding a way out. Realizing there were no walkable paths, they noticed the pool of water appeared to drain somewhere. <em>Sszarden</em> sent lights down while <em>Garus</em>, using his <em>Cloak of the Manta Ray</em>, swam to the bottom. There, they found treasure, including an alchemy jug, a magical greatsword, and a chest filled with 2800 gold pieces. Garus also spotted an opening where the water was being sucked through.</p>\n<p>Having no other option, the group dove into the pool and swam through the underwater tunnel. After a brief, intense rush of water, they were ejected into the open air, landing in a plunge pool below. They swam to shore and found themselves in an open field. <em>Zen</em>, using his abilities, spoke to a daffodil, which informed them they were near <em>Lake Stanskas</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Nym</em> recognized the area from his youth and realized they were about half a day's journey south of <em>Upper Lachis</em>. They traveled north for a few hours before encountering a friendly farmer who allowed them to camp in his field. They set up their magical <em>NutToButHut</em> for the night.</p>\n<p><strong>Yaldra&rsquo;s Warning and Journey to Upper Lachis</strong></p>\n<p>Before resting, <em>Yaldra</em> telepathically checked in with <em>Nym</em>, warning him that while the portals needed to be destroyed, they also needed to take down whoever was behind the whole scheme. Nym recalled the name <em>Mephisto</em>, a powerful dark demon. Yaldra agreed to return to <em>Candlekeep</em> to research Mephisto further. She also informed them that she had told <em>Lord Mandleroth</em> the portals were destroyed, and that they last saw the <em>Rod of Rulership</em> in the <em>Shadowfell</em>. She mentioned that <em>Retta</em> was on her way to meet them at the library in <em>Upper Lachis</em> and instructed them to travel conspicuously to their destination.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the group continued their journey to Upper Lachis, arriving at the southern gate around noon. Entering through the <em>Narrowood</em> gates, they stopped at a local tavern called the <em>Jolly Mug</em> for a drink and an overpriced hamsteak. They quickly realized that the locals didn't seem to place much value on education and were unaware that a library even existed. One patron suggested it might be located in the forest near <em>Longbridge</em> and <em>Lost Cross</em>, where the nobles lived.</p>\n<p><strong>The Illuminated Meadow Library</strong></p>\n<p>The group headed north to <em>Lost Cross</em> and came upon a park-like forest in the middle of the city. Venturing in, they discovered a small cottage surrounded by circles of trees and beautiful landscaping. Approaching the cottage, they knocked on the scarab-shaped knocker, but no one answered. Upon entering, they found a long mahogany-lined hallway that led to a large room filled with tall bookcases. A mosaic ceiling adorned with scarabs loomed overhead, and in the center of the room, they noticed another cottage identical to the one they had just entered.</p>\n<p>After making some noise to alert anyone nearby, the front door of the second cottage opened. The group cautiously entered and found a tall, skinny, long-haired alchemist working with a mortar and pestle. He introduced himself as <em>Stephan Perry</em>, the head librarian of the <em>Illuminated Meadow Library</em>. While Yaldra had instructed them to see him, Stephan didn&rsquo;t seem to know who she was, nor did he have any knowledge about the portals.</p>\n<p>However, Stephan expressed interest in interdimensional travel, and the group reasoned that if they could retrieve the <em>Cubic Gate</em> from <em>Gerhart</em>, Stephan might be able to help them figure out how to use it. With this in mind, they began plotting their next steps.</p>",

Yaldra shared that some of her trusted allies were concerned about the current leadership, and advised that the most religious and trustworthy among them should hold the Rod for now. She also revealed that the portals needed to be destroyed from both sides to permanently deactivate them. For this task, they would need the <em>Cubic Gate</em>, which was still with <em>Gerhardt</em>, currently traveling to <em>Ponyo</em>.</p>\n<p>Their next best course of action, she suggested, was to head to <em>Upper Lachais</em> and consult with her librarian colleague <em>Barry</em>, who might know how to use the <em>Cubic Gate</em>.

Nicodemus went to scout and found two <em>Abishai</em>, which he tried, unsuccessfully, to intimidate. Soon after, a <em>Death Knight</em> riding a skeletal horse emerged, leading to a tense confrontation. After some back-and-forth banter, Nicodemus shouted, &ldquo;Mephisto sucks!&rdquo; and broke an illusory Rod of Rulership to provoke the Death Knight. The Knight, unable to physically grasp <em>Nicodemus</em> due to his incorporeal form, still managed to damage him with force blasts.</p>\n<p>Back at the portal, <em>Zen</em> informed the group of the situation. <em>Garus</em> and Zen then rushed through the portal, prepared to face the Death Knight head-on. With Garus blocking the Knight&rsquo;s path and both he and Zen landing significant blows, the Knight was eventually defeated when Nicodemus dropped the skeletal horse's body on top of its master. Victorious, but aware of the need for more rest, the group decided to stay cautious.</p>\n<p><strong>Rest and Movement to Upper Lachais</strong></p>\n<p>While some managed to gain a long rest thanks to potions, others only received a short rest.

Most of the group used invisibility to sneak, while <em>Garus</em> and the owl scouted stealthily. They soon reached the other portal, located in a damp, fungus-covered area. They noticed a freshly worn trail, though no obvious footprints were left behind. <em>Zen</em> peered through the portal and saw a vast cave on the other side with a pool of water.</p>\n<p>Before parting ways, <em>Nicodemus</em> offered to contact <em>Retta</em> and arrange to meet her at the library in <em>Upper Lachais</em>.

They quickly realize that the <em>Abishai</em> had orchestrated an ambush, waiting for the right moment to steal the <em>Rod of Rulership</em> and pin the blame on the Vanguard. Knowing that a corrupt king and court will likely scapegoat them, they decide to sneak out of the catacombs through the church.</p>\n<p>Lucy attempts to sense the rod\'s location, feeling a strong pull to the north. The group heads to the northern gate and runs into <em>Gerhart</em>, who agrees to take them along as he heads toward <em>Westin</em> on his way to visit a friend in <em>Ponai</em>. Before departing, <em>Szarden</em> sends his familiar <em>Rasputin</em> ahead to track the rod, while <em>Garus</em> uses his ability to look through Rasputin&rsquo;s eyes. After a short rest at a local tavern, they meet up with Gerhart and begin their journey north.</p>\n<p>During the journey, Garus removes his <em>Ring of Water Elemental Command</em>, and Szarden attunes to the staff they recovered. Gerhart examines the relics they took from the catacombs and reveals that they can command elementals. The relics include the <em>Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals</em>, the <em>Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals</em>, the <em>Censer of Controlling Air Elementals</em>, and the <em>Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals</em>.</p>\n<p>Curious, Szarden begins experimenting with the relics, guessing that the answers to the riddles inscribed on the walls must be the command words to summon the elementals. He tries summoning the water elemental by pouring water into the bowl and saying "ICE." Water leaps from the bowl and forms a water elemental on the ground. After safely dismissing it, they deduce the other command words: &ldquo;ASH&rdquo; for fire, &ldquo;SAND&rdquo; for earth, and &ldquo;TEMPEST&rdquo; for air. These new abilities might prove useful&mdash;if they survive until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>After traveling for several hours, Szarden and Garus, stationed atop the caravan, suddenly hear a voice cry out, &ldquo;He said you might follow us. This will be fun.&rdquo; They are ambushed by a very much alive <em>white Abishai</em>. A <em>black Abishai</em> lands on the caravan&rsquo;s roof, but before the fight escalates, <em>Mithac</em> arrives and swiftly takes both of them down. Her power as a paladin shines through. Mithac loots 700 gold and two scimitars from the black Abishai, while Nym loots the white one, gaining 600 gold and a staff with a blue gem. In the process, Nym comically falls off the caravan while trying to take the staff from the dead foe.</p>\n<p>Lucy&rsquo;s detection abilities reveal that they are getting closer to the Rod, and Rasputin, along with a flying Polonius, scouts ahead. They spot a campsite with two fires and tents blocked by large rock outcroppings. Gerhart quietly parks the caravan, and the Vanguard sneaks up to investigate. They find a <em>green Abishai</em> emerging from one of the tents, and in typical Vanguard fashion, attack swiftly. Just as they are about to finish it off, a <em>blue Abishai</em> steps out of a cave nearby, holding the <em>Rod of Rulership</em> aloft. Nym, Zen, Lucy, and Garus are instantly mesmerized by the rod&rsquo;s power and walk trance-like toward the cave.</p>\n<p>As the blue Abishai retreats into the cave, Polonius, Szarden, and Mithac finish off the green one and rush in to save their enchanted companions. Inside the cave, they find themselves in a centuries-old mining cavern, with both the blue and red Abishai lying in wait. Despite their best efforts, the rest of the Vanguard, still mesmerized, stumble into a portal at the far end of the cave, with the blue Abishai following close behind. The red Abishai knocks Mithac and Polonius unconscious, grabs them, and flies through the portal as well. Szarden, now alone, runs back to the cave entrance, only to find it blocked by a cave-in. Resigned to his fate, he crosses through the portal himself.</p>\n<p><em>Zen</em> wakes up in the middle of a serene hayfield. The air is peaceful and still, as if he&rsquo;s in a dream. As he gets his bearings, small green creatures dart in and out, approaching him cautiously. Looking up, Zen sees six figures standing over him, their forms blurry but vaguely familiar.</p>',

They found an old statue of <em>St. Adolphus</em> and dispatched a small <em>Gelatinous Cube</em> in a crypt before heading back out of the church. The streets were still relatively empty, but some townsfolk were beginning to move about. As the group made their way back to the <em>Dancing Donkey</em>, they were surprised to find <em>Arnold</em>, alive and well, helping his father, <em>Wolfgang</em>, repair the tavern.</p>\n<p><em>Gerhart</em> explained that the group had been gone for three days, indicating that time around the portal had been distorted. This revelation made the group realize that Gerhart must possess some unique powers, as Arnold had been "mostly dead" when they left for the church. After helping the townspeople clean up the dead bodies, <em>Szarden</em> reappeared, carrying a book, which he handed to <em>Mithac</em>. To her surprise, it was the very book that <em>Moose</em> and <em>Nicodemus</em> had been bound to&mdash;the book she had been seeking to destroy.</p>\n<p>Over drinks at the Donkey, Szarden recounted his and <em>Retta&rsquo;s</em> journey to <em>Candlekeep</em>, where Retta found a way to free Moose from the book. She agreed to help Szarden research his own issues while he returned with the book for Mithac. As they discussed their findings, the tavern door swung open, and a pompous-looking man dressed in finery entered the room. He made a beeline for Mithac, who greeted him with excitement, calling him <em>Polonius</em>. She introduced him as a lifelong friend who had come to help her find and destroy the book. Despite Polonius\' cold demeanor toward the rest of the group, they acknowledged it had been a long day and too much had been drunk, so they followed Gerhart&rsquo;s caravan to crash for the night.</p>\n<h3>On the Road to Coia</h3>\n<p>The next morning, while traveling toward <em>Coia</em>, the group decided to buy some of Gerhart&rsquo;s wares. After a lively game of <em>rollsies</em>, <em>Nym</em> purchased the <em>Manual of Quickness of Action</em> and immediately retreated to the barn to read. <em>Szarden</em> helped Gerhart drive the caravan while learning more about Coia. Gerhart told them that the <em>Rod of Rulership</em> was used during the founding of Coia and was a symbol for the first settlers. He also examined the chest found in <em>Soren&rsquo;s</em> office and suggested that <em>vials of dragon&rsquo;s blood</em> might unlock it.</p>\n<p>The first day passed uneventfully, with the party taking turns watching from the top of the caravan overnight. In the early morning, just as <em>Polonius</em> was ending his watch, a loud scream echoed from behind them. <em>Garus</em> turned to see a large red dragon swooping down toward the caravan, unleashing a burst of fire that scorched the group. The dragon then scooped Polonius up in its talon and flew off toward the <em>Cocker Mountains</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Gerhart</em> needed to continue his journey south, but <em>Mithac</em> convinced the group that Polonius wasn&rsquo;t such a bad guy and that they should rescue him. The party agreed and planned to meet Gerhart in the town of <em>Clifton</em>, a few miles south, after their rescue mission.</p>\n<p>They trekked up the mountain, where the air grew hotter, and the water became fouler, eventually reaching a large cave entrance lined with scorch marks. Inside, they found large steps ascending toward a light source ahead. While scouting the area, <em>Rasputin</em> spotted a <em>Fire Elemental</em> emerging from the wall just past the first chokepoint in the cave. Unfortunately, Rasputin did not survive.</p>\n<p><em>Zen</em> quickly cast <em>Wind Wall</em> to slow the elemental&rsquo;s advance, while the rest of the group rushed in to kill it. After defeating the elemental, they found <em>Polonius</em> lying on the ground. Mithac revived him, and he healed himself. Deciding they had the element of surprise, the party chose to confront the dragon head-on. As <em>Nym</em> spied a much larger <em>Fire Elemental</em> in an upper chamber, <em>Zen</em> and <em>Szarden</em> stepped forward to attack&mdash;only to feel an intense heat growing behind them.</p>',

Retta casts an image of herself inside, only to have it attacked by a slow-moving man. We charge in, knocking him back, which causes a ghost to emerge from him, much like what we saw with the librarian earlier. Things escalate as three more wraiths show up, along with the ghost of a bard named <em>Thallon Sparrow</em>. After an intense battle, we defeat the wraiths and Thallon&rsquo;s ghost.</p>\n<p>Once the dust settles, Nym discovers <em>Arnold</em>, Wolfgang's son, hiding behind the bar. Arnold explains that his dad started acting strangely about three days ago, and he&rsquo;s been scared ever since. Nym brings <em>Mithac</em> over to heal Wolfgang and Thallon. Just as things calm down, we hear a noise coming from <em>Golden Drops</em>, the local mead brewery. Without hesitation, Retta runs through the front door but is immediately stuck by oozing honey. Garus tries to jump in through a window, only to get stuck as well.</p>\n<p>Inside, Retta is attacked by a slashing creature, which she swiftly kills. The rest of the party enters through another window and finds another slasher hiding in the mead-maker&rsquo;s bedroom. We take him down too, only to discover that the brewer had been dead for days, eaten by the creatures. After Lucy frees Retta&rsquo;s tail from the honey, Nym tackles her, breaking her loose.</p>\n<p>We continue our investigation down the street, where we hear noises from within a well-maintained house. Given its condition, we assume it&rsquo;s the lord&rsquo;s manor. When we bust down the door, it triggers a trap&mdash;poison darts hit several of us. Inside, we find <em>Gideon Beckett</em>, the Mayor of Herthe, apparently asleep on his bed. Nym tries to sneak in, but the creaky floorboards give him away, and Beckett springs to life, attacking us with a sword. We knock him out and deal with yet another ghost. Ghost-hunting is quickly becoming our specialty.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Garus crosses the river and discovers an old graveyard, likely from Herthe&rsquo;s earliest settlers. He enters a lone mausoleum and finds a coffin containing the skeleton of <em>Daavid Herthe</em>, dressed in chain mail and clutching a sword. As Garus investigates the crypt, the rest of the party turns their attention to the <em>Church of the Forgotten Soul</em>, a centuries-old stone structure with a single set of double doors as the entrance. Despite its stained glass windows, the interior is hard to see from outside due to the grime.</p>\n<p>Just as we prepare to enter, we hear rustling nearby and encounter <em>Alistair Keaton</em>. He explains that he came to Herthe to meet his son <em>Emis</em> and recognizes some of us from Berkeso. He asks after Emis, and we nervously tell him that the last time we saw his son was back in Grantherton, while Nym and Retta fidget uncomfortably. Alistair goes on to explain that he and Emis were involved in some dark dealings and that undead creatures have been plaguing Herthe. New monsters seem to emerge from the church every few hours.</p>\n<p>Turning our attention back to the church, Retta tries to project herself inside but fails. We cautiously nudge open the front door and send Rasputin, our familiar, to scout ahead. He sees an empty church before a blinding flash of light snuffs him out. We break down the door and enter, feeling a chilling breeze as we step inside.</p>\n<p>Intricately carved pews lead up to the altar, but we&rsquo;re quickly ambushed by a group of zombies and skeletons. As we battle, a hulking figure with three skeleton heads emerges from behind the pulpit. Wielding a sword, he rains down ice on us while Garus becomes infected with zombism. Despite the brutal assault, we manage to defeat the three-headed figure, causing the remaining creatures to vanish. We search the area where the figure came from and find a loose tile in the floor, revealing stairs leading down. Too weakened to continue, we place <em>immovable rods</em> over the tile in hopes of blocking the monsters below from emerging while we rest.</p>\n<p>Outside the church, we meet up with Garus, who tells us about the mausoleum. Zen retrieves the chain mail and sword from Daavid Herthe&rsquo;s crypt, and Retta sets up a neon yellow <em>Nuttobuthut</em> for us to rest in while waiting for the next wave of creatures. As we settle down, Alistair announces that he&rsquo;s heading north to Grantherton, following the lead on his son Emis. Retta decides to go with him but not before revealing a note she received in Berkeso that said, &ldquo;Bring the party to Herthe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With the next wave of creatures likely less than 30 minutes away, we hope the immovable rods buy us enough time to catch our breath before the battle resumes.</p>",

Classic Gerhart. Meanwhile, young Samuel shares a childhood fairytale he remembers about a blue dragon named &ldquo;Tambourine the Dead Trumpet,&rdquo; who wreaked havoc on villages alongside Glacirax, the white dragon, and some red dragon he couldn&rsquo;t quite name. Gerhart corrects him, saying he&rsquo;s probably thinking of <em>Tamburas the Dread Tempest</em>, which might be the same dragon we crossed paths with earlier.</p>\n<p>Apparently, over the years, Tamburas has been blamed for all sorts of chaos&mdash;crop failures, missing livestock, and other unexplained disasters. Gerhart adds that there used to be a delicate balance between the chromatic and metallic dragons, keeping them in check, but something must have shifted recently, pushing the chromatics to leave their typical territories in the Berland Mountains far to the east and venture into the western regions of Coia.</p>\n<p>As we continue traveling, we spot smoke ahead and decide to slow down to investigate. We meet a half-orc named <em>Ted the Cold-Nosed</em>, who claims he&rsquo;s looking for his clan but seems suspicious from the start. When he catches the scent of dragons from Lucy&rsquo;s bag, he asks what we&rsquo;ve done to his &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo; And just like that, things spiral out of control. Ted reveals himself to be a white dragon and attacks, trying to freeze us.</p>\n<p>Things go from bad to worse when a red dragon swoops in from the sky to join the fray. The battle? Absolutely chaotic, but after some serious back-and-forth, we manage to kill the white dragon while the red one retreats, likely to plot its revenge for another day. Post-battle, we loot the white dragon&rsquo;s body&mdash;Lucy takes its dewlap, Garus snags a tail spine, Zen claims a fang, and we harvest the dragon&rsquo;s heart. We also find some <em>Dimension Shackles</em> on its legs, and Garus claims a <em>dragonslayer longsword</em> after disarming the orc-turned-dragon earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Herthe Ain&rsquo;t Exactly Happening</strong></p>\n<p>We hit the road again, with Gerhart healing us up along the way, and soon arrive at Herthe. Turns out, Herthe isn&rsquo;t the bustling city we expected. It&rsquo;s more of a quiet hamlet&mdash;no grand walls, just clusters of farms, houses, and shops scattered along the main road. Weirdly, there&rsquo;s no sound at all. Not a whisper of human life, not even a moo from a cow or a cluck from a chicken.</p>\n<p>We check out a few houses, but they&rsquo;re completely empty. Zen tries to get some answers by listening to the corn (don&rsquo;t ask), but even the corn is tight-lipped. Helping ourselves to some supplies from the empty general store, we eventually notice some movement near a cart by the apothecary. Sszarden sneaks over and finds a human woman hiding there. She introduces herself as <em>Mithac Fezim</em> and says she&rsquo;s from Aveton, sent by <em>Soren Lorenson</em>. She&rsquo;s hunting for a group of travelers, one of whom is a barbarian with something evil she wants to destroy.</p>\n<p>Feigning ignorance, we nod along and promise to keep an eye out for those mystery travelers. She seems to go into a trance, suddenly sensing movement in both the apothecary across the street and the tavern behind us. We decide to check out the apothecary first, where we&rsquo;re immediately attacked by <em>Julianna Birch</em>, the town librarian, who appears to be possessed by a ghost.</p>\n<p>After a quick but decisive fight, we manage to exorcise the ghost, and Julianna regains consciousness. She&rsquo;s confused and can&rsquo;t remember much beyond opening her shop door, being blinded, and then waking up in the apothecary. With Julianna safe, we send her home and, naturally, loot her shop for good measure.</p>",

At a desk, sits a man. You&rsquo;d think a guy sitting calmly in a room full of adventurers would be a red flag, right? But before we can even process his presence, he snaps his fingers and&mdash;surprise!&mdash;we&rsquo;re trapped in a magical, invisible cage. Classy move.</p>\n<p>Turns out, this guy is a scientist. And not just any scientist, but the smug, &ldquo;I-don&rsquo;t-care-about-your-stupid-town&rdquo; variety. Apparently, the whole place is asleep because he&rsquo;s running some ridiculous experiment in his <em>mobile research space</em>&nbsp;because, you know, who doesn&rsquo;t want their evil lab on wheels?</p>\n<p>Naturally, we try to question him, because maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;he&rsquo;ll give us something useful.

Meanwhile, Leto decides to stay behind for a few days, probably to recover from his <em>fourth</em> near-death experience. The rest of us? We meet back up with Gerhart and set off for Herthe.</p>\n<p>With a little downtime, we actually take a closer look at our caravan. It&rsquo;s a cozy little barn setup&mdash;six stalls, some with hay, others with random tools and items. But in one of the stalls, we stumble upon Samuel, a stowaway. This poor kid&rsquo;s got a tragic backstory: mom died in childbirth, dad got toasted by a blue dragon last week, and now he&rsquo;s on his way to Herthe to find his uncle Rabbard.</p>\n<p>Naturally, we decide to inform Gerhart. Climbing up a ladder to a catwalk, we cross a rope bridge that connects the barn to the farmhouse.

They step into a pentagon-shaped room, already dreading whatever new horror awaits. And they&rsquo;re not disappointed. In the center of the room stands a large pillar, but it&rsquo;s the creepy puppets stationed in each corner that immediately grab everyone&rsquo;s attention. There&rsquo;s one for each element: fire, chrome (because why not?), water, earth, and stone. What could possibly go wrong?</p>\n<p>Leto, ever the brave fool, approaches the pillar, and as if on cue, the puppets spring to life. Suddenly, the room becomes a chaotic death trap as the puppets unleash <em>super-wide</em> beams of elemental doom across the room. We&rsquo;re talking fire, poison, rocks&mdash;it's a buffet of destruction. Leto, bless him, goes down <em>repeatedly</em> like some kind of elemental punching bag. Every time he&rsquo;s revived, <em>boom</em>&mdash;back on the floor. It&rsquo;s almost impressive, if it weren&rsquo;t so tragic.</p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker: we figure out that the puppets are all part of some larger, sinister creature. Great. So now it&rsquo;s a matter of whacking away at the puppets, dodging beams, reviving Leto for the umpteenth time, and hoping not to die in the process. After an agonizing battle, we manage to defeat the creature&mdash;finally. And just when we think we might catch a break, we notice hidden latches on each of the pedestals. Naturally, we press them (because why not?) and the central pillar opens up. Inside? The Cup of the Five Elements. Retta hands it to Nym, and there&rsquo;s no time to admire the thing before we&rsquo;re off again.</p>\n<p>We head into the next antechamber, utterly exhausted, and take another brief rest. No sooner do we catch our breath than we&rsquo;re facing a bridge swarming with shadow monsters below. Not wanting to stick around and become monster chow, we pull out all the stops&mdash;flying, teleporting, you name it&mdash;to cross the bridge without getting swarmed. Somehow, miraculously, we make it across unscathed.</p>\n<p>But because this tower apparently has <em>no chill</em>, we stumble into a massive library next. At first, it seems quiet enough&mdash;just rows upon rows of bookshelves. But then a disembodied voice, dripping with menace, tells us not to trespass. As if we&rsquo;ve got a choice in the matter! We try to comply, half-heartedly searching for an exit, but surprise, surprise&mdash;we get attacked anyway. This time, it&rsquo;s a <em>Liondrake</em>. Because apparently, one can&rsquo;t have a simple, peaceful library in a cursed tower.</p>\n<p>The Liondrake wreaks absolute havoc. It&rsquo;s smashing bookshelves, dropping lights on us, and generally making our lives miserable. Half the party gets crushed under falling debris or blasted with fire. Exhaustion sets in. Things are looking bleak. But we manage to deal enough damage to the beast to slow it down. Meanwhile, Nym, probably sick of the whole ordeal, runs around like a madman trying to find the exit. Just as the party is hanging on by a thread, Nym fires an errant arrow that miraculously strikes the Liondrake dead.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a sloppy victory, but hey, at this point, we&rsquo;ll take what we can get.</p>",

The group stumbles downstairs, groggy but on edge, only to find the town far too peaceful for comfort. Retta and Nym, of course, show up looking like they&rsquo;ve had a <em>very</em> different kind of morning, their knuckles still dusted with dried blood. Whatever happened last night, they aren&rsquo;t keen to share the details, and frankly, no one has the time to pry. More pressing matters are at hand.</p>\n<p>Like the fact that the entire town is asleep. Not in their beds, mind you&mdash;no, that would be too normal. These folks are out cold, frozen mid-task, like some twisted village-wide nap party. People slumped over in chairs, half-eaten meals, dropped tools. It&rsquo;s as if the entire town hit "pause" all at once and just layed down. Probably.</p>\n<p>To top it off, Emis is missing, and that&rsquo;s never a good sign. The group checks his room&mdash;empty, of course. Typical. But before they can begin their search, who should roll up but <em>Leto Black</em>, looking all too calm as he offers his assistance. Great timing as always. Leto, ever the observant one, points out cracks in the ground, glowing ominously, leading toward the forest. That&rsquo;s definitely not a good omen, but the real showstopper? A massive tree in the distance that absolutely <em>was not there yesterday.</em> Super.</p>\n<p>So, off they go toward this mysterious tree, which is now sitting atop a tower like the world&rsquo;s most ominous houseplant. They find a door on the side, as one does, and what do you know? They step inside and are immediately teleported to a dimly lit room where they can&rsquo;t see more than ten feet ahead. Because why not throw a shifting maze into the mix?</p>\n<p>As they cautiously navigate the maze, they&rsquo;re greeted by a skeleton scorpion. You know, the usual. After a tense skirmish, they finally put it down and narrowly avoid a fire trap. Just another Tuesday, really. Eventually, they make it to the other side of the maze, but the surprises don&rsquo;t stop there.</p>\n<p>No, because now they find themselves in a long hallway lined with mirrors and windows. And not just any mirrors&mdash;unbreakable mirrors. Oh, and the windows? Just casually displaying TV programs of gardens because apparently, even ancient towers need a little landscaping inspo. While most of the group proceeds with some degree of caution, Nym&mdash;being Nym&mdash;throws that all out the window, bolts down the hall, and promptly vanishes. Classic. Szarden, not one to let Nym take all the glory, follows suit, and poof, he&rsquo;s gone too.</p>\n<p>After smashing what feels like a hundred mirrors, the group finally hits the right one, freeing Nym and Szarden from their pink mist prisons. But they don&rsquo;t even get to pat themselves on the back before another curveball gets thrown their way: the final mirror at the end of the hall shatters, unleashing their evil doppelg&auml;ngers. Because of course it does.</p>\n<p>Evil Nym, unsurprisingly, puts up quite a fight, dealing some serious damage. But Leto&mdash;always the hero&mdash;swoops in and wipes out half the evil clones in a single stroke. Zenhorn, meanwhile, gets infected with a black blob parasite because, at this point, why wouldn&rsquo;t that happen? The group manages to finish off their evil twins, but not without some serious bruises and battle scars.</p>\n<p>Finally, the chaos dies down, and they stumble into the next room, which, blessedly, is quiet and empty. It&rsquo;s been a long, weird day, and they decide to rest. Not that resting in a haunted tower with evil mirrors ever feels <em>truly</em> restful, but they&rsquo;ll take what they can get.</p>',

As if we needed more reasons to end this were-bard menace. The group doesn&rsquo;t hesitate; one off-key chorus of "Baby" is enough to light a fire under their arrows, bolts, and spells, and they rain chaos on these sonic offenders before their ears start bleeding.</p>\n<p>But, plot twist: these aren&rsquo;t just your run-of-the-mill bad singers. No, these tone-deaf nuisances are actual <em>were-bards</em>, and suddenly, the boy band becomes a full-on wildlife documentary gone horribly wrong. A bear, a boar, a tiger, and a rat&mdash;yes, a rat&mdash;stand where the crooners once did.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the group takes cover behind a large wall, landing some solid hits. You&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;d be the end of it, but nope. The universe loves a curveball, so <em>poof!</em> the bards vanish, only for one massive werewolf to materialize, ready to tear them apart. And boy, does he. The group is barely holding on by the skin of their teeth before the werewolf pulls a Houdini and vanishes just as quickly as he appeared. Were&rsquo;d he go? Oh, we don&rsquo;t know. Somewhere unpleasant, hopefully.</p>\n<p>Then, like some twisted version of <em>The Voice</em>, they hear singing from inside the houses. This is getting ridiculous, right? But we press on. The wood house is up first. Nym and Emis sneak in, ready to put an end to the next set of backup singers. Inside, they square off with the boar and the rat&mdash;honestly, this is starting to feel like the world&rsquo;s worst circus act&mdash;while the rest of the team blasts holes in the roof and snipes from above. A perfectly reasonable approach.</p>\n<p>Once the rat and boar are dispatched, attention turns to the stone house. This one? Not so easy. The group tries every trick in the book to bust inside, but the stone house laughs in the face of their efforts. Finally, Leto gets fed up and blows the door wide open, and the group rushes in, ready to face whatever abomination awaits. Inside, it&rsquo;s the bear and tiger.

Were-tiger got him good, it seems. But hey, it&rsquo;s probably nothing, right? Just a flesh wound!

Inside the upstairs room, we spot none other than Soren Lorenson&mdash;a large, athletic, battle-hardened monk, and Nym&rsquo;s long-lost friend from Durmchapel. Picture it: the once-noble warrior now wrapped in the shadowy folds of Red Cloak treachery. And he&rsquo;s sitting there, calm as a summer breeze, as if this is all some casual chat over tea.</p>\n<p>Soren kicks off his sob story by swearing that he never <em>meant</em> to hurt Nym. Yeah, sure. He explains how he once stumbled upon the Red Cloaks torturing monks outside the monastery, trying to weasel info out of them about some mysterious artifact called "The Gate." And, of course, in classic tragic anti-hero fashion, when the Red Cloaks caught Soren snooping, they made him a deal: help them steal the artifact, or die a messy death.</p>\n<p>Naturally, Soren caved. He threw Abbot Dain under the proverbial wagon, using the secret entrance through the cellar gate to help the Red Cloaks sneak in. Did he know they&rsquo;d butcher half the monks? Of course not. And isn&rsquo;t that always the excuse? He genuinely seems relieved that Nym made it out alive, even recounting how he spared Nym&rsquo;s life outside Glastonwood all those years ago. Touching, right? Except it&rsquo;s all hollow when you&rsquo;ve left a trail of dead monks in your wake.</p>\n<p>Nym, ever the optimist, tries to pull his old friend back from the abyss. "Come on, man, you don&rsquo;t have to do this! We can fix it!" But Soren, predictably, claims he&rsquo;s in too deep. The Red Cloaks aren&rsquo;t the kind of crowd you ghost and live to tell the tale. So instead of rekindling their bromance, Soren signals his bodyguard to attack and hollers for backup from the Red Cloaks downstairs.</p>\n<p>Enter Zen, firing off a zipline arrow through an open window because what&rsquo;s a dire situation without some action-movie flair? The group scrambles to slide across to the nearby building while fending off Soren&rsquo;s bruiser. Nym gives one last heartfelt plea, but Soren&rsquo;s only response is a fleeting, guilty glance toward a chest in the corner. Hmm, interesting.</p>\n<p>After knocking both Soren and his bodyguard unconscious (because nothing says closure like beating up your old friend), Nym snatches the chest. With guards pounding up the stairs, the group ziplines out of there like a scene from a heist movie, narrowly avoiding capture. Aveton&rsquo;s no longer safe for them, so they hightail it to the eastern side of town and find Gerhart Duskwood, a caravan leader who&mdash;thankfully&mdash;offers them passage to Gaston, the next town over.</p>\n<p><strong>Into the Tree?</strong></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get trippy. After making it to Gaston and staying the night at the Whaling Cow, things start to feel&hellip; off. Maybe it&rsquo;s the ambiance, or maybe the patrons are smoking some seriously strong stuff because next thing we know, Moose is introducing us to some guy named Lucy, who, in turn, leads us to&mdash;wait for it&mdash;a tree. A tree that we casually stroll <em>inside</em> of, only to emerge in the middle of a battle arena.</p>\n<p>And because the weirdness never ends, we meet another newcomer, Leto Black, who seems decent enough, considering we&rsquo;re in an arena conjured by a magical tree. After a few rounds of good old-fashioned combat, the group is rewarded with shiny new gear like it&rsquo;s some kind of bizarre, enchanted giveaway show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zen picks up some Arrows of Walloping (because who doesn&rsquo;t want to knock people flat on their butts?),</li>\n<li>Sszarden scores a Dragonwing Shortbow (he&rsquo;s probably not going to shut up about this one),</li>\n<li>Retta gets herself an extra spell slot (as if she needed more power),</li>\n<li>Emis is handed a Grey Bag of Tricks (you know, for summoning adorable but deadly animals),</li>\n<li>Nym claims a Periapt of Wound Closure (hello, instant health insurance),</li>\n<li>And Leto, the new guy, gets a Clockwork Amulet (perfect for turning the odds in his favor).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just when we think it couldn&rsquo;t get more surreal, the arena officials (or whoever&rsquo;s running this magical circus) tell us about a roving band of <em>were-bards</em>&mdash;yeah, you heard that right. These lycanthropic minstrels roam the land, biting, raiding, and pillaging while they serenade their victims. Nobody likes a boy band, especially one that also happens to be a murder-happy wolf pack. Our mission? Hunt them down and put an end to their musical reign of terror.</p>\n<p>Of course, in true "magic tree" fashion, it conveniently spits us out into a new area, and just like that&mdash;battle stations.

                    "session_report": '<h1>General Summary</h1>\n<p>The group awakens to find Retta holding Diothenes at bay. Tensions are running high as Retta is miffed that she was bounced off by the racist forcefield surrounding the cabin. Zenhorn is pleased that he was able to seize the magic Stormbow off Jayson before he died. Sszardan is questioning his loyalty to this group once after he again missed the elusive magical bow he&rsquo;s been searching for. Nym is upset that he wasn&rsquo;t able to react quick and effectively enough to slow Moose&rsquo;s rage. Moose is still calming down after satiating his bloodlust. And the entire group is pissed at Diothenes and demanding answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Diothenes swears that he has no idea what happened. He swears he is an Great Reader at Candlekeep and was researching Redevus Branch. He doesn&rsquo;t remember the last few weeks and doesn&rsquo;t know how he got to Aveton. No longer having Jayson Boothebarrel around to confirm his story, we decide to ask Lord David Lee to return him to Candlekeep where they can sort out what really happened.</p>\n<p>Returning to the castle, we are greeted by one of the citadel guards who has been looking for the group to pass along a Sending Stone from Yaldra with strict instructions to keep in contact as progress is made on the &lsquo;task.&rsquo; We ask about the quickest way to Herthe and he tells us about caravan passage to Herthe that usually leaves after lunch from the eastern gates of the city.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lord David Lee Roth meets with us and agrees to send Diothenes to Candlekeep. He seems to be in an aggressively bad mood and when we ask for our payment, he turns his back and slams the door in our face. Maybe Sachia did remember what happened after all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Deciding not to press our luck, we returned to the Deadfish Tavern and decide it would be a good idea to have a group therapy session. Over a hearty breakfast we talk about our lives, our loves, our hopes, and our dreams. Feeling closer than ever and like we&rsquo;ve had enough quality &ldquo;us&rdquo; time, we attempt to get more information about the Red Cloaks. The barmaid tells us to try the warehouse by the docks, so we head out there after Sszarden gives Nym a makeover so that he looks like Dannish.</p>\n<p><strong>At the Warehouse</strong><br><br>We head to the docks where we find the warehouse; a massive wooden structure 3 or 4 stories tall 55&rsquo;x90&rsquo; large, few small windows high-up, large hangar-like door on the western ocean side likely to allow fishing boats to be brought in for repair, the foundation in the water is stacked stone mortared in-place except where the hangar door swings out to allow access, single door with peeking hatch &amp; wrought iron strapping encasing it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nym confidently approaches the front door and knocks. A small hatch open and two small eyes peer out and ask what he wants. He identifies himself as Dannish and asking to speak to Soren, claiming that he has the ring he wanted. He&rsquo;s told that Soren isn&rsquo;t there and is promptly denied entry. As Nym tries to convince the doorkeeper of his intentions, he hears a bell ring as the hatch shuts. Archers suddenly appear from the top floor and Zen casts a cloud of fog on the group for cover. Emis turns himself and Nym into beetles to crawl under the door. Once inside he charms the were-tiger doorkeeper into being a friend who then opens the door for the others.<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking around, we find ourselves in a large dimly lit room, 50&rsquo;x75&rsquo;, open ocean taking up most of the space with working walkways around 3 sides. Crates and barrels are scattered around the perimeter. The walkway is 3&rsquo;-4&rsquo; above the water and the ceiling is an additional 20&rsquo; beyond. A small single fishing boat is moored farthest away from the massive ocean access door.<br>&nbsp;<br>We notice 3 ropes of different colors (red, silver and green) attached to bells next to the door. The green bell is still swinging from when the doorkeeper pulled it a minute ago. We let him know that we&rsquo;d like to sell the ring and he quickly pulls on the red rope and we hear that bell ring. A cloud of darkness drops on the group and we see a Hill Giant bouncer come out of a nearby room. Deciding to get it over with all at once, Sszarden grabs the silver rope and rings that bell, causing another door to open revealing a Shadowblade Drow who acted as a fence for the Red Cloaks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh it&rsquo;s on&hellip;<br>&nbsp;<br>Moose begins to float in the air while Sszarden starts shooting. Nym takes a flying leap with his quarterstaff and slips and falls into the water. As he does, he hears an annoying voice cry out "Where am I? Who goes there?" that apparently only he can hear. Realizing there must be a soul trapped in his ring, he suddenly feels overwhelmingly lucky and jumps out of the water, ready to fight.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the group has already killed off the Weretiger, Hill Giant, and Shadowblade Drow. Searching through the room were the Drow came from, they discover it to be an office filled with a good deal of loot, a set of keys, and a lever. The keys open up another panel with more loot, and as they pull the lever, they see the staircase descend from the ceiling.<br>&nbsp;<br>Up we go&hellip;</p>',

At the tavern, the barmaid notices Sszarden&rsquo;s outfit and tells them that the Red Cloaks are essentially an underground mafia and if he walked around looking like that, the group would be inviting trouble.

He claims to have experienced the same disorientation that we had and didn&rsquo;t know why he was there.

We entered the arboretum next door and found a box guarded by some harpies.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jayson immediately attacked them when he entered the room and after a brief battle, we dispatched them. We found some good loot in a box; Moose found a chain with a silver skull (the Amulet of the Planes).<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Turning to another room, some of the group go in only to find they can&rsquo;t speak in that room.

After some mild infighting, the group comes to their senses and continues down to the library.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They find another blue circle and again after stepping on it, half the party turns and needs a beat down to come back.

The group ventures upstairs to find a very cold room with a little girl on the bed in the middle.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They try to console her, but as they approach, she turns into an old hag and attacks.

For most of us, it beings peaceful memories of simpler times.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Sszardan remembers images of his pampered life in the Underdark as a Menzoberranzan family, a typical morning meal where he places a recently deceased frog in his empty porridge bowl for the scullery maid to find. His older sister Lareth and little brother Rizzen both shake their heads in disapproval. <br><br>Zen&rsquo;s memory flashes to a crisp early winter morning just this past season, tracking a doe. The earthy smell of snow-covered dawn, the chilled air biting the skin on the rims of his nose.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Nym remembers a warm summer day in the fields outside of the monastery in Durmchapel with Abbot Dain organizing games with the other boys.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Emis recalls picnicking with his mother Raenis, not a care in the world.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Moose dreams of foraging the game trails near his home outside of Herthe, his mouth-watering thinking about the hearty evening meal being prepared by his mother for him, his two older brothers, and his sister.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Retta dreams begin peacefully enough as she dreams of harvesting vegetables for dinner behind their cottage on the outskirts of her small village. Her mother leans her torso out the low window, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the tomatoes &amp; okra this time,&rdquo; her face a golden red with the late afternoon sun dipping behind the low hills. But suddenly the colors change to blood red, purple &amp; black bruises appearing on her cheek, a duo of puncture wounds revealed on her bosom, the result of a senseless, ignorant rage. The sun quickens its pace below the horizon and a cold wind cuts across field.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>A dark figure steps around the side of the cottage. The last rays of sunlight illuminate Marat&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Something broke my connection to the other one, but you will suffice. You are one of Asmodeus&rsquo; ilk, small &amp; weak. Help bring me what is mine and I can restore what, or who, you desire most. Or, you can perish like your parents did.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She recalls her mother slumped over the windowsill, motionless. Her father in bed, staring at the ceiling uncertain if he is breathing. &ldquo;This troop of misfits is no family. They don&rsquo;t trust you. This path you are all on is futile. It will end in eternal damnation&hellip;&rdquo; with a crooked smile Marat proposes, &ldquo;Our kind must stick together&hellip;&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She awakes in a cold sweat.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Let&rsquo;s Go Shopping!</h3>\nMostly feeling refreshed, we decide that since we&rsquo;re flush with cash and have a few hours to kill until the boat leaves, we head into town and split up to buy some gear. Nym heads over to the Pigment of Truth: Tattoo Shop which is part of the Thieves Guild. There he purchases a Ghost Step tattoo before noticing a wooden plaque with a painted carving of a red cloak. <br><br>Inquiring about it to the shop owner Brylniss, she confirms that the plaque is a sign that they are part of the Red Cloaks Thieves Guild. They are mostly beggars, burglars, con artists, cutpurses, pickpockets, thugs, with the occasional spies &amp; assassins. She&rsquo;s aware that Soren Lorenson is currently up north in Aveton.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;<br><br></span>Sszarden cries poor as usual and is trying to and bum cash off of Moose to buy something when he spots the Drow Priestess of Lolth from House Dhunnarn across the marketplace. He tries to follow her but loses her in the crowd. He explains to the group that his posh existence ended when several houses, including House Dhunnarn, murdered his entire clan in the <strong class="article-unlinked">Night of the Shattering</strong>.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Back on Board</h3>\nThe group convenes at the docks, surprised to find it\'s their old buddies Captain&nbsp;<a class="article-link article-explorer-link tooltipstered" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/rondak-svatomir-person" data-article-privacy="public" data-article-id="16a0d810-1959-41e1-99bc-592734af96c8" data-template-type="person" data-article="16a0d810-1959-41e1-99bc-592734af96c8">Rondak Svatomir</a>&nbsp;and First Mate&nbsp;<span class="private-article article-unlinked" data-article-privacy="private" data-article-id="4aceca97-1ddf-4972-80a0-d59f5bc165e1" data-template-type="person">Kanighar Rostik</span>&nbsp;on the Horizon Reacher who are taking the princess to Avalon. Ron explains that the ship has been fixed up but it\'s a skeleton crew and he needs the group to work the ship and offers free room and board in exchange. <br><br>The only others on board are the hired hand Geeloth Smote, and the princess who&rsquo;s already locked safely away in her cabin.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The first few days proceed fairly uneventfully. On the first night a mermaid jumped up onto the ship, but Sszarden yelled loudly at her and frightened her away. On the second night we docked in Bamney to re-supply but nothing much happened.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>On the third night, shit got real.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>During the first watch, they notice a ship coming up behind them. Sszarden says, "I think we\'re being followed." Emis looks back and shouts "inconceivable!" Retta turns into gas and accompanies Szarden&rsquo;s owls to fly behind them and scout out a ship that coming up on them fast.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Piloting the boat was a Merrenoloth who possessed an oar that glowed at the tip. Also on board were a Sea Hag, Sea Spawn, a Marid Water Genie, and a Water Elemental Myrmidon. Emis turns into a snake and swims toward their boat while he and Retta cast spells like Wall of Thorns that cause them to take damage as their boat gets closer to us. These spells mostly killed off their crew. Zen and Szarden shoot down the Marid but the Water Elemental Myrmidon is able to leap onto the Horizon Reacher. It&rsquo;s able to do some minor damage to Kanighar before Nym, Moose and Zen kill it off.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Retta floated behind the ship and had to swim to catch up while Emis swam to their the boat. As Retta got aboard and dried off, she found a note in her pocket. As Emis looted the boat he found a message in a bottle. Neither revealed their contents. The group tied off their new boat to the Reacher and went to bed.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',

When they reach the Library, they find their old friend Jayson Boothbarrel dangling his little legs off a bookshelf waiting for Yaldra to come back. <br><br>They discover that Candlekeep sent Jayson to get a book from the Shimmering Elm Library.

Jayson joins them and they head out to the Copper Worm Inn in the Six Lodges District.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>On the way, some of them hear a strange clawing sound. To the surprise of everyone, Retta suddenly turns into a puff of gas and moves towards the sound, flowing under a door to a nearby house.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The group approaches and can hear the scratching getting louder. It sounds like it\'s coming from just behind the front door.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Suddenly a small girl comes crashing through the window and lands almost on top of Sszarden trying to bite him. They realize she\'s a vampire and quickly dispatch of her.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Cautiously heading into the house, they find the remains of what they assume were her parents in the bedroom. It appears the little girl became a vampire, killed her folks, and then was trying to escape.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>With nothing more to do, the group heads to the Inn for dinner and bed.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Trouble in the Night</h3>\nIn the wee hours of the early morning, noises from outside awaken the group. Zen sees figures running outside at inhuman speed and quickly alerts the others. Thinking quickly, Jayson runs down to the kitchen to grab some shallots apparently for an odd late-night snack. The group gathers downstairs and sees what look like vampires running from the river to the Library.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Explosions sound off in the distance from all areas.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Emis says "I\'ve got an idea!" and then runs off toward the water without another word. Retta says "I\'ve got an idea!" and then runs off toward the Library without another word. The rest of the group decide it\'d be best to warn Yaldra and see if she has anything they can use to fight the vampires with.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They arrive at the Library and wake Yaldra and explain the situation. She gives them a small vial of holy water, tells them all she knows about vampires, and agrees to alert the town guards, lords, and appropriate staff. She suggests that if they can kill the Master vampire, the others will disintegrate.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>As the group leaves the Library, a bright light like the sun comes shining from the river.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Assuming this to be Emis, they run there to find he is distracting the vampires with his balls. The group noticed 13 magical boats with red crescent moons on them docked at the harbor. After careful study, they determine that the boats move backward and upward in a straight line. Hoping to keep the vampires from escaping, they tie up half the boats and move the others up out of the water.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Nym looks behind him and sees a castle in the sky. Deducing this must be where the master vampire is, the group commandeer two boats and row, row, row up to the castle.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Castles in the Sky</h3>\nDocking the boats, they approach the castle to discover mystical writing at the entrance. They translate this to "IN NOMINE DOMINI NOCTIS PORTAS MORTIS APERIRE". Having no scholars in the group, they shrug and try just saying the phrase while touching the door, and fortunately it opens up to them.&nbsp;Entering the castle, they find themselves in an empty hall.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As the group explores the various rooms to find wolves, bodies, food, etc. Sszarden notices a shimmering in the wall and finds a hidden room containing three pillars with red, green, and blue cat gems on them. He grabs the Red one (which turns out to be a good luck gem) and as he does the other pillars sink into the ground and the gems disappear.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>One by one, they find themselves feeling a call in their heads and Moose, Jayson, Ssarden, and Retta all walk into the Lair as if under a magic spell. Concerned about their friends, Zen and Nym run into the Lair to find the Vampire Master sitting on his throne at the end of the room while their friends stand in a pool of blood staring around. The Vampire Master laughs maniacally and attacks.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Nym and Zen chase him around the room, but he\'s a tough one, firing a Legendary action every couple turns, and his Lair gets to throw up walls and jets of blood.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A pack of wolves soon show up to join in the fight. During the battle, Moose gets attacked and wakes up out of his trance to join in the fight. Jayson takes out some of the wolves while Sszarden and Retta flail around in the blood singing praises to the Master.&nbsp;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The group drive the Vampire Master out into the hall where a strange floating muppet assists by hurting him so they can destroy him.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>He blows up when destroyed and the castle and island start to immediately fall apart. The group runs for the boats and quickly row back to shore as the island falls into the ocean behind them.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>They make it back to town to find the vampire threat is gone.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',

The Horizon Reacher finally docks around breakfast time, and Captain Rondak Svatomir, looking none too thrilled, announces he&rsquo;s restocking and setting sail around noon. He&rsquo;s clearly eager to unload these adventurers causing chaos on his boat, but with his crew numbers dwindled, he strikes a deal: passage to Tetbury in exchange for their help on board. Classic.</p>\n<p>Kelro bids us farewell, leaving the rest of us to kill some time window-shopping. And by window-shopping, I mean half-heartedly poking around market stalls for anything remotely useful. Of course, you can&rsquo;t walk two feet in this town without stumbling onto some shady dealings. We overhear talk of slavers and a mysterious woman offering a bounty for information on Drows. Something about some escaped Drow who slipped through the Wormwrithing tunnels and now have slavers sniffing around to haul them back to the Underdark. Sszarden, unsurprisingly, isn&rsquo;t thrilled by this news.</p>\n<p>Into the local watering hole we go&mdash;Whelan's Watering Hole, to be exact. Inside, we spot a young girl in a red cloak sitting alone. Prime target for some information, right? Nym, ever the charmer, tries his luck hitting on her. And by \"luck,\" I mean he crashes and burns spectacularly. Enter Sszarden, who transforms into the guise of Dannish and makes his approach. The girl, clearly recognizing the disguise, spills that Soren has left Calimport early, changing the meeting point to Aveton. With that cryptic nugget of information, she scurries away.</p>\n<p>The plan? Head back to the ship. But, because nothing is ever straightforward, who do we run into outside? A high-society woman, exuding that aura of smug superiority. Sszarden, ditching the Dannish act, reveals his true Drow form. And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it? Our lady of sophistication isn&rsquo;t what she seems either. In a flash, she transforms into Masral Rife, a Drow Mage, backed by her elite warrior buddy and a couple of grumbling bugbears.</p>\n<p>What follows is a battle that&rsquo;s over practically before it begins. Swords clash, spells fly, bugbears snarl&mdash;all to the backdrop of a bustling port. The tide quickly turns in our favor. In a glorious finale, Retta steps forward, channeling dark energy into her palm, and delivers a devastating Eldritch Blast that obliterates the Drow Mage. Talk about overkill.</p>\n<p>With the mage and her minions dispatched, we high-tail it back to the Reacher just in time to see it pulling away from the dock. The next two days at sea? Blissfully uneventful, though Sszarden takes the opportunity to lay down some heavy lore. He spins us the tale of the \"Night of Shattering,\" where House T'Sarran was annihilated by a coalition of other Drow houses, all led by none other than Lady Zilvra of House Bedjir. That ruthless matriarch built her fortune on the slave trade, and our recent encounter was a clear sign she&rsquo;s still got her hands dirty.</p>\n<p><strong>Tetbury Tales</strong></p>\n<p>The grand city of Tetbury finally comes into view, home to nearly 40,000 residents&mdash;a sprawling metropolis by any measure. We waste no time and are swiftly directed to the Library of the Shimmering Elm. Here, we meet Yaldra Bretik, the resident mage historian. Out pours our tale of Altherstab&rsquo;s portal and the demonic encounter, leaving her with a thoughtful, furrowed brow.</p>\n<p>Yaldra enlightens us about the Bukhara Spires&mdash;ancient portals created when Coia&rsquo;s early settlers had mastered trans-dimensional magic. Beautifully etched with intricate runes, they were designed to act as barriers against otherworldly incursions. Yet, they also had the handy side effect of allowing whole legions to cross vast distances in an instant. A clever piece of magic, dormant for ages&hellip; until now. If these spires are indeed active and connected to the Shadowfell, then some powerful demon must be pulling the strings.</p>\n<p>She mentions a tome&mdash;'The Spires That Started a Race'&mdash;kept in Candlekeep, which might contain the locations of these portals. Naturally, she sends us off to retrieve it. Because, of course, it always has to be the party that does all the dangerous work, right? Well, at least we have a new lead. Onward to Candlekeep!</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p>Morning arrives, and as the group awakens to find that no one has perished overnight, they decide to seek out Lord Arris to inquire about the bounty. They make their way to Castle Beresko, noting its outdated structure, which seems more decorative than defensive. After requesting an audience, Lord Arris explains the situation: rumors of a creature terrorizing travelers and local farmsteads. His teenage son, Arzida, reportedly spotted a goat-like being near the lakeshore wildlife trail between Berkeso and Bedine. Lord Arris offers a bounty of 50 gold pieces for proof of the creature's demise.</p>\n<p>Leaving Castle Beresko, the group heads south through East Town&rsquo;s bustling shops, crosses the Middleton Bridge, and exits through Mist Gate, following the trail along the lakeshore. They keep an eye out for any signs of the creature as described. After two hours of travel, they come across the partially devoured remains of sheep. Nearby, through a gap in the shrubbery, they notice a gentle slope leading away from the lake. An outcrop of metamorphic stone with eroded quartzite anticline forms the entrance to a small cave.</p>\n<p><strong>Cave of Rot</strong><br>The cave's entrance is dark and damp, littered with small dead creatures, forest animals, and livestock. The afternoon sun illuminates about 30 feet inside the cave. Inside, the main pathway leads to the right, while a smaller opening branches off to the left. The group proceeds to the right, entering a 25-foot-long, 8-foot-wide hallway that opens into a larger room with three alcoves.</p>\n<p>In the first alcove, they spot a creature: a squat, rounded Dretch with emaciated limbs. Its rubbery skin, shifting between beige and blue, is sparsely covered with bristly hairs and varicose veins. Its downward-slanted eyes, squashed nose, and pointed ears give it a grotesque appearance. It is feasting on a dead animal, shredding its flesh with small, fang-filled jaws and sharp claws.</p>\n<p>In the second alcove, a Rutterkin lurches about. This demonic humanoid, with its mottled green and blue-violet skin, has patches of wiry bristles and an elongated skull with backward-pointing ears. Its tiny red eyes are swollen with malice, and its body convulses in frequent, painful howls as it contorts and warps.</p>\n<p>The third alcove contains a dead Dretch. The group attacks, slaying the live Dretch and the Rutterkin. Finding nothing else in this area, they return to the cave entrance and head left. After squeezing through a tall but narrow opening, they find themselves at an intersection marked by natural stone stalagmites and stalactites. To the left is a small chamber housing two imps. Deeper within the cave, they see another Dretch accompanied by a Bulezau.</p>\n<p>The Bulezau is an imposing, 9-foot-tall creature, resembling a gaunt, skeletal minotaur with curved ram-like horns and clawed feet. Its flesh, covered in filth and open, festering boils, exudes the stench of carrion. Patches of short, wiry bristles cover its body, and its long, serpentine tail ends in tangled steel-like spines. Its goat-like head has pale, crusted-over eyes and needle-like fangs hidden beneath foam-caked lips. Beside it lies a blood-dripping ransuer, seemingly too large for its thin frame.</p>\n<p>The group battles their way through the imps, the Dretch, and the Bulezau. In an intense skirmish, Nym delivers the final blow, decapitating the Bulezau to bring back as proof. They make their way back to Beresko Castle to claim the reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Back in Beresko</strong><br>By the time they return to Beresko, night has fallen, and they must wait until morning to present their bounty. The group heads to the Green Crab Inn for a meal, where they notice a lone woman named Retta. Seeking work, she introduces herself, and the group agrees to let her join since they are down a member. After getting to know Retta, they retire for the night, with Emis and Retta sharing a room.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Nym wakes early and heads to the tavern for breakfast. Azmira sets a plate of ham and eggs along with a mug of ale. As Nym takes a sip, he notices the silhouette of Nicodemus, who sits down across from him. Nicodemus appears pale, hungry, and hollow-eyed. The surroundings darken, and Nym becomes frozen in place.</p>\n<p>Nicodemus speaks, but his voice is not his own; it is the voice of the demon they encountered in the Shadowfell. \"You think yourself wise by destroying one of my gates. Yet you are foolish not to realize I have many more. You think yourself strong by destroying one of my wildling minions and his pack. Yet you are so weak to easily kill one of your own party. You, monk, have spilled first blood. Now, I will send my hordes to spill yours! And once I finish collecting my artifacts, I will collect your souls, starting with you! What&rsquo;s the matter, not thirsty?\"</p>\n<p>Nym shakes his head and sees Azmira standing beside him, asking if he is alright. Realizing it was a vision, he recounts the encounter to the group. They then head to Castle Beresko to present their proof.</p>\n<p>Upon meeting Lord Arris, they dump the Bulezau&rsquo;s head onto the floor. His advisor, Ethohs Funsani, shrieks at the sight and remarks that where there is a Bulezau, a Nabassu demon is often nearby or connected via the Shadowfell plane. When the group mentions the portal they destroyed in Altherstab, Ethohs speculates that it might have been an ancient Bukhara Spire, a portal link to the Shadowfell. He suggests that these portals must be destroyed and recommends they consult Yaldra Bretik, a mage historian at the Library of the Shimmering Elm in Tetbury, for further information on the Bukhara Spires.</p>\n<p>Pleased, Lord Arris rewards the group with 10 gold pieces each and promises a favor if needed in the future. As they leave the castle, Emis spots a familiar figure and runs off without saying a word to the group.</p>",

He bolts up in a cold sweat.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The following morning, the group head out to Berkeso and notice that the red-cloaked man is also journeying that way. After some attempts at small talk fail, they pass him but remain wary. Later in the day we come upon&nbsp;<strong class="article-unlinked">Berkeso</strong>.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The first part of the town proper we see is the long, continuous stonewall encircling most of the buildings. Deep inside the northeast part of the town you can see a small castle spire peeking just above the walls. Likely where the ruling nobles reside. As we get closer, we see a massive wooden &amp; stone gate that guards the only entrance and also begin to notice the condition of the walls &amp; gate. While impressive from a distance, upon closer inspection it appears that this is either an old fortification that hasn&rsquo;t been kept up, or it was more recently built in haste with little attention to detail.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;State your name and purpose before entering Berkeso.&rdquo;&nbsp;The guard, Mephis Funsani, bellows as he appears from inside the gate house.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&ldquo;Are you here to collect the bounty? My lord keeps pestering me about it&rdquo;. After asking more about the bounty, the guard informs us that something has been pestering the town lately. He tells us that if we\'re interested to stop by the castle in the morning and request an auidence with <strong class="article-unlinked">Lord Arris</strong>&nbsp;&amp; Lady Nulura Adeben. Nicodemus inquires about any other strange visitors and the guard notes that a pair of travelers came in very early this morning, before sunrise, asking about water travel. He sent them down to the Great Docks, there&rsquo;s a vessel leaving for Aymock at first light tomorrow.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Heading over the bridge from East Town to the Dairyborough, this looks like the stereotypical &lsquo;wrong side of the tracks&rsquo; part of Berkeso. Following our noses to the fish smells, we enter the Great Docks area after sunset. Moored to the main gangway is a stout 2-masted ship with the faded name&nbsp;<strong class="article-unlinked">Horizon Reacher</strong>&nbsp;painted across the stern. We meet Captain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/rondak-svatomir-person">Rondak Svatomir</a>&nbsp;and First Mate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/kanighar-rostik-person">Kanighar Rostik</a>. They tell us that Horizon Reacher sails a route from Berkeso to Aymock on Kilkburgh Lake, out through the river to the ocean and on to Calimport, Tetbury, Bamney, ending at Aveton. <br><br>It\'s a two-month round trip. Cargo is loading now and passengers load before sunrise tomorrow morning. Most waiting to embark usually stay at the only dockside lodging, &ldquo;The Green Crab Tavern.&rdquo;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>We head to the Green Crab and chat with the barmaid Azmira. She\'s lodged a few groups waiting to board the Reacher tomorrow, but a shifty pair of dark cloaked men rubbed her the wrong way and she told them there&rsquo;s no more available bunks. She pointed them to a warm alley next to the warehouse. <br><br>We\'ve been sweet-talking her so she says she actually does have only a couple rooms for the night so we\'ll have to share.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>After dinner, we\'re curious about the shifty men and head around the corner to the alley. The passage is blocked by some wooden crates which we move but they release a booby trap of poison. Venturing past them we come across 2 cloaked humanoids. <br><br>The shorter creature quietly jibbers in foreign language that sounds like fey or sylvan language &ldquo;I think we should leave.&rdquo; The taller one tries to excuse themselves out of the alley, glowing tattoos peaking out from his cloak sleeves. As they try to shove past us, a fight ensues and as the taller one pulls a dagger on us, so we kill them both.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Examining the bodies, Moose finds some Boots of Elvinkind. He opens the taller one\'s coat to find 2 books, a saucy little adventure tale titled "Adwynne and the Styr" and a larger book titled "The Book of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">M</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">". Before Nicodemus has a chance to notice, Moose opens it up to look through it for information.</span></div>\n<div><br>As soon as Moose begins to read from the book, Nicodemus bursts into flames. Taken by surprise, the group watches in horror as his body quickly incinerates leaving nothing but ashes on the ground where he once stood.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Shaken by this, the group quietly heads back to their rooms for a restless night of sleep. <br><br>Moose reads a bit more of his book to discover that it\'s a book of knowledge and whoever reads from it is bound to it. Once a new person reads from it, it severs ties with the previous person and kills them. Moose realizes he\'s now in the same predicament that Nicodemus was, and decides to carefully guard the book with his life.</div>',

                    "session_report": '<h2>General Summary</h2>\n<div>It is a crisp early morning after we rested in a few of the empty houses. Last night, dark thoughts of the poor villagers entered some of our dreams while we slept in their vacant beds. And again, this morning as we feasted on the rations left in haste just the other evening. Slowly the party gathers outside one of the houses.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We see Udamis &amp; Unefi, the master carpenter &amp; his apprentice son, walking towards the group. Despite their best efforts to appear calm and patient, it&rsquo;s fairly obvious that Udamis is anxious to start the trek towards the mountain portal.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I trust everyone has had a sufficient breakfast? I can&rsquo;t thank you all enough for offering to help us find my wife &amp; daughter. And here is the 10GP I promised to you all once they are found.&rdquo; Udamis reaches into his belt, unties a small leather pouch and shakes it briefly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll add another 20GP if you can help me bring back my love Innith.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Madashlak chimes in. You didn&rsquo;t notice him approach the group from the other direction.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Traveling north out of the village, you are able to fairly easily follow the path back into the mountains. As we travel, we notice a faint pulsing blue light and sound, alternating about every 30 seconds. And like the Hobgoblin Captain said, after a day of trekking you turn a corner in a narrow hill passage and come upon a familiar scene in the distance, 7 makeshift wooden jails.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This time they&rsquo;re filled with the missing women and children of Altherstab.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Just beyond the cages is the source of the blue light and heavy bass sound. Standing about 18-20ft tall is this crude stone construction. Forming almost a perfect circle with a chunk missing from top, the center of the structure is empty and big enough for a large beast to easily step through. Looking closer though, we see that the center is not actually empty; the air in the center of the structure looks more like a liquid. With each heavy bass sound, ripples move across the viscous oily sheen. The color shifts from blue sky to silvery gray to black. This must be the portal that the Hobgoblin captain mentioned.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, another pulse of the portal. With your eyes adjusting to the strange setting, you can now make out other things moving around, both inside and outside of the cages. Three of the cages still have prisoners sardined into them. There is one goblin closing the door on a now empty cage and three other goblins lurking around, between the fire pit and the portal. And this time from the far side of one of the cages closest to the portal, a goblin emerges and walks towards the opening. A few seconds more and it steps into the void, and disappears. Four goblins remain guarding the cages on this side of the portal. We attack and kill them before freeing the prisoners from the cages.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Madashlak sees his wife, Innith, rushes to her and swallows her in his outstretched arms. After a few moments of embrace she tells the group, &ldquo;Hurry, we have to save the others. They&rsquo;re just on the other side. These goblin assholes were able to shove 5 or 6 of us through before you finally showed up&rdquo; Udamis comes rushing over after having unlocked the other cages and freed everyone. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Thariz &amp; Umarra? Where&rsquo;s are they?&rdquo; Innith points over to the portal.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Mountain Portal to Shadowfell</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Cautiously dipping his head into the portal void, Emis discovers a desolate, demonic landscape. As your party musters the courage, everyone ultimately steps through. As we cautiously step into the center of the stone structure, a chilling sensation starts up our leading legs, like dipping a toe into a cold spring stream&hellip;.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Stepping fully through that chilling subsides, but the air is still noticeably cooler. The expanse before us is dimly lit, as if after sunset on a foggy day. The grassy hills and mossy rocks have been replaced by jagged stone walls and narrow paths. To our left, the edge of the pathway drops 30-40ft. straight down before another narrow ledge appears. To our right, the rockface extends upwards and away from you so you can&rsquo;t really make out how far up it goes. We can see on the path in front of you the footsteps of someone or something that recently passed this way. And far in the distance, as our eyes follow the path along the mountains edge, we see something poking above the fog.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>It&rsquo;s too far to tell if it&rsquo;s something natural, or something that has been constructed.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Walking forward just a short distance as we&rsquo;re turning a corner to our left you hear faint crying up ahead. About 50ft away the pathway widens and a few more cages are now visible, flanking the path. But these cages are older and more worn from repeated use. It&rsquo;s still too far and dim from where we&rsquo;re standing to make out details, but it looks like a little girls&rsquo; foot can be seen in the corner of one of the cages.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>We also see something approaching the cages that resembles an enormous toothy mouth surrounded by a small plethora of stubby appendages. Its squat, bulbous body is practically split in half to accommodate its giant gullet and arms. Its hide is a shade of dull brown. As the creature gets closer to the cages the low crying is joined now by screaming from the other cages.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;<br><br></span>We are able to kill the death maw, but as it dies it releases a loud screech that echoes off the mountainside and awakens something darker. We rescue the villagers in the cages, Thariz and Umarra among them. Thariz describes the horror she was forced into, the midnight raid in Altherstab, being taken prisoner and getting marched to the portal, watching her friends and neighbors being dragged into this unknown. Some of the other less fortunate villagers were taken by the goblin horde and headed towards the structure about an hour ago.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Just then a low thunderclap can be heard in the distance. Looking in the direction where the noise originated we see that structure about 1000ft. ahead in the distance that before we couldn&rsquo;t quite tell its&rsquo; nature, is looking more like a ruined small castle, or keep. And from within that space a faint glow and movement can be seen.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A very large shape steps through the portcullis and stands up. Even though it&rsquo;s very far away, this thing is large enough to make out a humanoid shape. It raises one arm towards your group and a voice stabs your minds,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;I seeeee youuuuu&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Thariz suddenly bends down and picks up a rock and attacks Nym. We quickly are able to subdue her as break the spell on her. She seems confused, &ldquo;Hmmph? What happened? Why did you hit me, why did I try and kill you, what&rsquo;s going on? I could see a large dark&hellip; demon I guess, on the horizon.&nbsp;Hundreds maybe thousands of people, all different races, were chained together and moving towards that creature.&rdquo;<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Just beyond the rusty metal cages there is a split in the paths. To the left it descends, to the right it&rsquo;s mostly flat, with the occasional small hill climb. Decomposing castle keep in the distance looks to be reachable on the right path. But parts of the path along the way disappear around a corner or beyond a hill rise. To the left, a familiar smell of maw demons can be picked up and we see a switchback trail that after a couple of acute turns in the path, it disappears beneath a dense fog. To the right there are no new smells so the party decides to head this way.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>After coming to a roundabout, we are set up by a Bodak leading 2 hell hounds on leashes. The Bodak is a formidable foe and as the party realizes they are no match, they quickly beat a path back to the portal and stepped back into the familiar continent of Coia.</div>',

                    "session_report": '<h2>General Summary</h2>\n<div>Our scene opens at dusk on a cool spring day in a small grassy clearing at the base of the western portion of the towering Cocker mountains. The air is crisp with the faint aroma of fresh cut timber, overturned earth and the evening meal almost ready for serving.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>As most of you regain consciousness and survey your surroundings, you find yourselves divided among a trio of cramped, newly constructed wooden jails, stripped of your possessions, your weapons, your armor.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>For some of you this is an all too familiar feeling. For others, without the protection of your steel and leather, the fear of death is becoming tangible.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>While the sun is still above the mountain peaks to the west, you have just enough light to vividly display the tragedy before you. Three 5ft x 5ft wooden jail cells, arranged in a line, each overcrowded with three individuals. Clearly these structures are not meant for long term confinement, but they are sturdy nonetheless.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>In the first wooden jail are what look to be three human males, but only two of them appear to be moving. It&rsquo;s not clear if the third person is still unconscious, or worse, dead.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>In the center cell, the half-orc barbarian,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/moose-knuckle-person">Moose Knuckle</a>, begins to rise to his feet. His face is partially covered with dried blood and from the very few cuts you can see on his body it&rsquo;s likely that only some of that blood is his.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Next to the barbarian another half-orc starts to awaken. As he rolls over you see the articles of clothing left on him, a small leather apron and stout boots, are those often worn by a blacksmith. Lastly, stuffed into the corner of this prison cell, we see&nbsp;<a class="article-link article-explorer-link tooltipstered" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/sszardan-t-sarran-person" data-article-privacy="public" data-article-id="43f5ec66-aa08-45c8-89eb-96c812beed3b" data-template-type="person" data-article="43f5ec66-aa08-45c8-89eb-96c812beed3b">Sszardan T\'Sarran</a>, a draugh of child-like proportions compared to these two half-orcs. Sszardan is awake and alert, but clearly shaken by the recent ordeal that landed him in the cell.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Occupying the last wooden jail are the rest of our unfortunate group.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/emis-faralei-person">Emis Faralei</a>, the half-elf, is leaning against his cage wall trying to assess just how dire a circumstance he has gotten himself into this time. On the ground but still breathing, we see the half-elf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/nicodemus--person">Nicodemus</a>. From the laceration on his pointed ear and dried blood in his hair, it&rsquo;s obvious he took an unexpected blow to the head just before blacking out and being dragged to his cell.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Finally,&nbsp;<a class="article-link article-explorer-link tooltipstered" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/nym-lenore-person" data-article-privacy="public" data-article-id="d7298273-b388-4efd-ad5f-763167f4757e" data-template-type="person" data-article="d7298273-b388-4efd-ad5f-763167f4757e">Nym Lenore</a>, a wood elf, is calmly sitting in lotus pose, his eyes closed, his breath steady, waiting.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>About 20-30ft. away you can see the campfire where a spit holds a chunk of meat that crossed into the well-done territory about 10 minutes prior. Next to the fire, a small creature about 3ft tall, stands with its back to you, fixated on the food. Squinting your eyes to block out some of the campfires&rsquo; interference you can see what looks to be a Mane creature. With its pale bloated skin, nearly hairless, and crawling with maggots, it currently doesn&rsquo;t look to be an active threat.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Occupying the fourth corner of this deadly square you can see a pair of Wretched creatures. They evil monsters are the feeling of wretchedness, personified. They have pudgy bodies on two legs with huge leach-like mouths. Something has their attention and curiosity, as they scratch at the ground near of pile of debris.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>POW camp escape</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The group is able to successfuly pick the locks on their cages and escape, without alerting the Mane or Wretched and find a pile with almost all their belongings. Nicodemus is dismayed to discover that a book of great value to him is missing. They are joined by some prisoners from the nearby town of Altherstab: Madashlak Bohdon (a blacksmith)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/udamis-uuthrak-person">Udamis Uuthrak</a>&nbsp;(a carpenter) and his son Unefi.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>They sneak past the creatures and head east but are quickly stopped by the site of another campfire. There is a fairly well constructed animal skin tent near the fire and they see another Goblin seated on the far side of the fire. But there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be anyone, or anything, else around. They attack the goblin which alerts the Goblin Boss inside the tent to come out and join the fight.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The group is able to kill the goblin and goblin boss but after the skirmish is over, Udamis and Unefi look visibly shaken.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As best they can tell, Altherstab is at least 15 miles southeast out of the mountains. As eager as they are to make sure their family is safe, it is likely too far to travel now as night sets in. The group makes camp for the night to set off and speaking with Udamis reveals the story of the attack on Altherstab.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Descending from the perimeter mountainside in the dead of night, a goblin horde at least 20 strong, surprised the sleeping village. But even in broad daylight, the simple famers and tradesmen would be no match for a war party that size. Some were slain but most, like us, were captured. A lucky few were able to escape and hide in the nearby forested hills south of the village.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>The Ashes of Altherstab</h3>\n<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The following morning, the group travels to Altherstab and find the charred remains of the homes and shops. You cautiously walk into a clearing from the north, into the Old District section of the village. This is where most of the shops, and the only tavern, used to be. All you see before you now are the charred remains of a once pleasant and thriving community. To the west of the town center they find Paki Serepet the old tavern owner, sifting through her legacy.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Looks like I&rsquo;ll have to start over again. Bastards broke every one of my plates. I&rsquo;m sorry Nicodemus but it looks like all the books you wanted were burned up too.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She hid in the cellar when the fighting started but had to make a dash for the woods when she smelled smoke and knew her establishment was set to flame. While in the cellar she heard a couple soldiers talking, but she couldn&rsquo;t make it out. It was another language, maybe goblin. The way they were moving around the bar and smashing things, it was almost as if they were searching for something.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Continuing south to the Moon Garden section of town where most of the villagers lived, we find a dozen or so homes are still standing and we see movement near some of the intact houses.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As we search the area, we stumble upon a Hobgoblin and the Hobgoblin Captain. We attack and kill the goblinoid, while questioning the captain about where the villagers are. He reveals that the women and children are being held about a days&rsquo; journey north into the Cocker mountains. Nicodemus finds some written orders that he claims tell us to go to Berkeso.

                    "session_report": "<p>The streets of Coia City buzzed with life, a dizzying maze of vendors shouting, children laughing, and the mingling scents of exotic spices and street food wafting through the air. Beneath its vibrant facade, though, the city held an ominous tension, like a coiled serpent ready to strike. The party moved cautiously, their eyes scanning for threats and allies alike, as they made their way to the Sanctified Garden&mdash;the old priory where Uriel had once served.</p>\n<p>The priory was a shadow of what it had once been, its stones weathered and worn, the gardens overgrown and wild. Uriel&rsquo;s expression softened as they walked through the gates, a bittersweet mixture of nostalgia and sorrow in his eyes. But it wasn&rsquo;t long before they met Jarmand Safe, the new deacon of the priory. Jarmand was a wiry man with a nervous energy, eyes darting around as if he expected someone&mdash;or something&mdash;to be listening in. He welcomed Uriel with a handshake that felt more like a plea than a greeting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ve been disappearances, Uriel,&rdquo; Jarmand whispered, glancing over his shoulder. &ldquo;Members of our flock, gone without a trace. And Ciril&hellip; well, let&rsquo;s just say he was happy to see you leave. Like it took a weight off his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Uriel&rsquo;s face darkened, his jaw clenching as memories surfaced. The departure had stung, a dismissal that had felt like exile. Now it seemed there had been more to it than he&rsquo;d realized.</p>\n<p>With heavy hearts and newfound purpose, the party left the priory and made their way to the bustling market square. They needed supplies and weapons&mdash;anything that might give them an edge in the battles that surely lay ahead. The market was an explosion of colors and sounds, rows of weapon stalls gleaming with polished steel and racks of arrows fletched with bright feathers. The party stocked up on blades, bolts, and vials of strange-looking potions. Dig, always one for flair, couldn&rsquo;t resist stopping at a tattoo parlor tucked away in an alley. Inside, the walls were covered with intricate sketches and bizarre symbols, and the tattoo artist&mdash;an elderly tiefling with purple skin, black hair, and sharp eyes&mdash;set to work, inking a pattern across Dig&rsquo;s forearm that seemed to dance in the dim candlelight.</p>\n<p>After the shopping spree, they turned toward the towering Silvanus Cathedral, the grandest structure in Coia City. Its spires rose high above the rooftops, piercing the sky like the fingers of a skeletal hand reaching toward heaven. The stone walls were covered in intricate carvings of vines and animals, giving it an eerie, almost sentient quality. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of incense and echoes of hushed prayers.</p>\n<p>They requested an audience with Ciril, the Archbishop, but were instead greeted by Bishop Methnea Toothless&mdash;a sharp-eyed, thin-lipped woman whose voice held the patience of a mother and the cunning of a fox. She seemed more interested in deflecting their questions than answering them, offering vague reassurances that everything was fine and that Ciril was &ldquo;far too busy to meet with every visitor.&rdquo; But Uriel&rsquo;s persistent questioning wore her down, and at last, with a sigh and a weary glance, she led them deeper into the cathedral.</p>\n<p>The inner atrium was grand, an open space filled with warm light that filtered through stained glass windows depicting saints, battles, and miracles. They waited in silence, their senses on high alert. Finally, Ciril arrived. He was an imposing figure, his robes flowing like a river of midnight, his face framed by a carefully groomed white beard. When he saw Uriel, a smile spread across his face, but something about it was off. Too wide, too practiced.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uriel,&rdquo; he said, his voice as smooth as honey. &ldquo;How long it&rsquo;s been. I trust your travels have treated you well?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The party exchanged wary glances. Ciril&rsquo;s voice held no warmth, only calculation. Still, he invited them to stay for dinner, his words dripping with hospitality, yet somehow hollow, like a polished apple concealing rot. They all sensed the danger, the trap laid in plain sight. But the chance to glean information was too tempting to resist.</p>\n<p>With quiet resolve, they accepted, following Ciril down the cathedral halls to a grand dining room, its walls lined with ancient tapestries and a massive table set with an elaborate feast. They took their seats, nerves on edge, weapons close at hand, bracing themselves for whatever schemes lay hidden beneath the Archbishop&rsquo;s polished smile.</p>",

                    "session_report": '<p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The abandoned cottage was falling apart, its crumbling walls and sagging roof barely holding back the night. The party&mdash;Uriel, Tonks, Harry, and Dig&mdash;had huddled inside, trying to get some rest after the brutal clash with the giants. The flickering firelight cast long, wavering shadows against the rough wooden walls, and the air was thick with the musty scent of rotting straw. The place was far from comfortable, but comfort wasn&rsquo;t what they were after. What they needed was time to breathe, to collect themselves. What they got instead was vengeance.</span></p>\n<p>Without warning, the ceiling above them exploded in a shower of splintered wood and dust as massive boulders smashed through, shaking the entire cottage like an earthquake. Giants, driven by fury and the bitter taste of defeat, had come down from the mountains to exact their revenge. They&rsquo;d tracked the party to this forgotten corner of nowhere, and now the ground shuddered beneath the weight of their fury.</p>\n<p>Dig, the bugbear monk with a taste for chaos, was the first to react, running out to meet the Giants and grinning wildly as if relishing the mayhem. He flexed his claws, eyes gleaming with anticipation. Tonks leapt to her feet, bow in hand, moving with the fluid grace of a hunter. Uriel, the broad-shouldered cleric, stood beside her, a pillar of strength with his reddish skin gleaming in the firelight, long blond hair whipping around as he surveyed the chaos. Harry, the young wizard with the eyes of someone who&rsquo;d seen too much too soon, raised his staff, muttering a hasty incantation.</p>\n<p>The giants crashed through the surrounding forest, their massive forms blotting out the morning sun. They were enormous creatures, with skin like cracked stone and eyes burning with hatred. Their roars shook the very walls, and the stench of their breath filled the air, thick with the odor of blood and unwashed flesh. One giant threw a javelin the size of a tree trunk, imapling Dig through his leg and scattering the party like leaves in a gale.</p>\n<p>But these adventurers were not so easily cowed. Uriel let out a battle cry and charged, his war chains held high. He met the giant&rsquo;s club with a resounding crash, muscles straining as he held his ground. Tonks loosed arrows with deadly precision, her eyes narrowed with icy focus. She moved with purpose, each arrow finding its mark in the joints and weak spots of the giant&rsquo;s thick hide. Harry, sweat beading on his brow, chanted under his breath. He unleashed a torrent of fire that lit up the area, the roaring flames reflecting in his eyes. The smell of burning flesh filled the air, and the giant howled in pain.</p>\n<p>Dig, meanwhile, pulled the javelin out of his leg and darted between the giant&rsquo;s with a chaotic energy all his own. He was everywhere and nowhere, delivering quick strikes and then slipping out of reach just before the giant could react. At one point, he scrambled up the creature&rsquo;s back like a squirrel up a tree, latching onto its head and landing a series of furious blows, beating the giant into a blue bloody pulp.</p>\n<p>The battle seemed endless. The giants fought with savage fury, and the party countered with desperate determination. The cottage around them crumbled with every clash, until there was barely more than a skeleton of broken beams and shattered furniture. But eventually, through grit and sheer force of will, they felled the two behemoths. The giants&rsquo; bodies lay in the ruins, their final breaths rattling from their chests as the dust settled and the silence returned.</p>\n<p>There was no time to waste. The party knew they couldn&rsquo;t linger in the shattered remains of the cottage. They gathered their gear, wounds still fresh and aching, and set off back to the nearby town of Pony. As they approached, the town was just beginning to wake up, the first rays of dawn breaking over the rooftops. But their attention was immediately drawn to the airship they had arrived on&mdash;a massive, lumbering vessel with sails billowing in the wind. It was preparing to leave.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hold on there!&rdquo; Rooster shouted, his voice carrying across the distance as he waved his arms wildly. The captain, Amarreta Noctonic, turned and squinted at the commotion. With a gruff grunt, she signaled the crew to lower the gangplank, and the adventurers boarded just in time.</p>\n<p>The voyage to Coia City was anything but smooth. Violent storms tore at the airship, lightning illuminating the rolling clouds in brilliant flashes. Rain lashed at their faces, and the deck swayed treacherously beneath their feet. Harry fought to keep his footing, muttering curses under his breath as he clung to the railing. Uriel stood steadfast, the wind whipping through his hair, while Dig cackled at the storm as if daring it to throw him overboard. Tonks, ever the pragmatist, tied herself to a mast and kept a wary eye on the storm clouds.</p>\n<p>After what felt like days of battling the storm, the airship finally limped into Coia City, the capital and largest city on the continent. The city was a sprawling mass of marble towers, cobbled streets, and bustling marketplaces. From the air, it looked like a patchwork quilt of grandeur and grime, with the shimmering spires of the palace standing in stark contrast to the narrow, winding alleys below.</p>\n<p>The party disembarked, convincing the captain to stay for two days so they could investigate the city&rsquo;s religious orders. The captain, ever the shrewd businesswoman, agreed to use the time to repair the ship&mdash;though not without reminding them that time was money. As they made their way toward the city gates, the party was confronted by a bored-looking guard who eyed them with thinly veiled contempt.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Entrance fee,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand. The party exchanged glances, sensing a shakedown but lacking the energy to argue. After a bit of grumbling, they paid up, and the guard waved them through with a smirk.</p>\n<p>Once inside the city, the mood shifted. The streets were alive with the hum of activity, but there was an undercurrent of unease. The adventurers couldn&rsquo;t ignore the whispers and sidelong glances, the sense that something sinister was lurking beneath the surface. They set off to investigate the mysterious disappearances of anyone who dared speak against the church. The tension was palpable, like the quiet before a storm. They knew they were walking into dangerous territory, but they had come too far to turn back now.</p>\n<p>The party passed a Wanted Board with the names of each member of the infamous Dragonbone Vanguard, offering 500gp dead or alive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retta</li>\n<li>Sszarden T\'Sarran</li>\n<li>Emis Faralei</li>\n<li>Moose Knuckle</li>\n<li>Lucious Lucy</li>\n<li>Nicodemus Hartwick</li>\n<li>Garus Silenus</li>\n<li>Nym Lenore</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so, with the shadows lengthening and the stakes rising, the party ventured deeper into the heart of Coia City, ready to face whatever awaited them.</p>',

                    "session_report": "<p>After their heated clash with a lumbering hill giant&mdash;a grotesque brute with breath that could sour milk at a hundred paces&mdash;the party barely had time to revel in their victory. Just as the dust began to settle, a shadow darkened the mountainside. And not just any shadow&mdash;no, this was the kind that blots out the sun and sends the birds fleeing from the trees. A colossal blue giant emerged, looming like an angry thunderhead. Its eyes burned with malice, muscles rippling beneath its azure skin like the swell of an ocean storm.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the mountain, Harry and Oz stood frozen, listening to the faint echoes of their comrades' battle reverberating through the jagged cliffs. Every crash and roar bounced off the rocky crags, distorted by the wind but unmistakably filled with the chaos of combat. Their hearts raced, but there was no way to reach the others in time.</p>\n<p>Back in the fray, the hill giant, panicked and wild, snatched up a boulder the size of a carriage. With a grunt, it hurled the rock with terrifying force toward the party, the air hissing as it cut through the sky. Instinct took over. The party exploded into action, bodies moving in a blur as they dove for cover, barely dodging what could&rsquo;ve been a crushing end. But the giant, thick-headed as ever, wasn&rsquo;t sticking around. No, it turned tail and began its desperate escape, lumbering up the mountainside in great, earth-shaking strides.</p>\n<p>Of course, the party wasn&rsquo;t about to let this oversized fool get away. Boots pounded the rocky path, dirt and pebbles kicked up in their wake as they gave chase, adrenaline pumping through their veins. And then, just as the hulking beast reached the crest of a ridge, Tonks&mdash;a deadly smirk on her lips&mdash;drew her bow. With a smooth, practiced motion, she loosed an arrow that sailed true. It struck the hill giant squarely between its beady eyes. For a moment, the giant swayed on its feet, eyes going wide with shock, and then it toppled over, a mountain of flesh crumbling into a heap.</p>\n<p>Bodo, Shanon's brother, scoffed as he kicked the giant's now-lifeless form. \"Those brutes treated me like a damned pet,\" he growled, brushing dirt from his armor as though the very thought sickened him.</p>\n<p>But there was no time to dwell on Bodo&rsquo;s past grievances. The party&rsquo;s attention shifted to the structure the hill giant had been fleeing toward. What they found was far from ordinary&mdash;an enormous metal edifice clung to the mountainside, its surface tarnished and cold, reflecting the dull light of the overcast sky. They climbed higher, finding themselves at the lip of a crater. Within lay the massive skeleton of a stone giant, its bones bleached white by time, resting like a fallen titan from another age. The sight was both awe-inspiring and eerie, the bones almost humming with ancient power. And there, nestled at the base of the giant&rsquo;s pelvis, were a set of iron doors, rusted but still imposing.</p>\n<p>Just as they set their hands upon the doors, disaster struck. With a roar that shook the very mountain, a fire giant charged. Its fiery red skin glowed like molten lava, and it crashed toward them, using the massive doors like twin shields. The ground trembled with each step, and before the party could react, the giant&rsquo;s brutal onslaught slammed into them. Shannon was the first to fall, her body crumpling beneath the crushing force of the attack. Then Dig, ever the brave fool, lunged forward. He managed to stun the creature with a well-placed blow, but not before the giant&rsquo;s hammer sent him sprawling, unconscious, to the ground.</p>\n<p>Uriel, however, was a mountain unto himself. The blows that felled his comrades barely phased him. With a roar of his own, he seized the opportunity, his sword flashing in the dim light as he drove it with deadly precision into the fire giant&rsquo;s legs. He sliced clean through its ankles, sending the behemoth toppling to the ground, howling in agony.</p>\n<p>Tonks, quick-thinking as ever, knelt beside her fallen friends. She fished out healing potions from her pack, tipping the liquid into Shannon and Dig&rsquo;s mouths. Within moments, their eyes fluttered open, pain replaced by determination.</p>\n<p>The fire giant lay defeated, and the party pressed on, entering the cave that gaped like the maw of some ancient beast. Inside, the air was thick and cold, with the scent of damp stone and something darker, older. The deeper they ventured, the more oppressive the atmosphere became, until the flicker of their torches cast long, eerie shadows against the walls. Dig, ever curious, rummaged through the debris left by the fire giant&rsquo;s hoard. Among the trinkets and discarded treasures, he found a piece of fabric sealed with wax&mdash;an 8th-level spell scroll. His fingers tingled as he held it, the raw magical energy practically humming through the paper.</p>\n<p>Shannon, however, stumbled upon something far more personal&mdash;her mother, Iriel Roth, locked in a cage, her once vibrant spirit dimmed by captivity. The reunion was bitter and sweet, Iriel&rsquo;s voice weak but urgent. She spoke of Mia Dewdrop, a meeting in Coia City at a high-class tavern called the Queen&rsquo;s Robes, and the strange disappearances of anyone who dared speak against the church. The streets, she warned, were becoming a barren wasteland of fear. And then there was Mangdor&mdash;Shannon&rsquo;s father&mdash;whose demeanor had grown cold, distant, after a recent trip surveying the kingdom. He had brought back a diamond&mdash;an enormous, glimmering stone mounted in a scepter&mdash;that seemed to radiate malevolence. Worse still, Iriel spoke of a new amulet, intended as a gift for Bishop Cyril Brazen, and whispered rumors of dealings with David Lee, Geddy&rsquo;s enigmatic partner.</p>\n<p>The weight of her words hung heavy in the cave as the party prepared to face whatever dark powers lay ahead.</p>",

                    "session_report": "<p>Just picture it&mdash;crisp northern air, biting at your skin, the small town of Pony barely more than a collection of shacks clustered around a dusty road, where the smell of burning wood and boiled cabbage lingers in the air. The party arrives, mood sour, after days of laying around on the airship that brought them here. This place isn&rsquo;t on any map worth reading, and it feels like the kind of place that time forgot&mdash;except Yon Yonson, self-appointed <em>portmaster</em>, greets them as if this town was the beating heart of some grand kingdom. With a toothy grin and a wave of his hand, he sends them toward the tavern, where breakfast and gossip await.</p>\n<p>Inside the tavern, the smell of sausages and stale ale hits them like a warm embrace, and despite the grime on the walls, it&rsquo;s a welcome change. <strong>Shannon Roxley</strong>, the sharp-eyed rogue&mdash;no, fugitive princess, but who&rsquo;s counting&mdash;sits down with her crew, her bright doe eyes surveying the room. Her hair, braided and neat, contrasts with the rough patrons gathered around, and her white bodice draws more attention than she&rsquo;d prefer. <strong>Tonks Nihlson</strong>, with auburn hair and a loose braid of her own, raises her tankard of beer without a care in the world, while <strong>Uriel</strong>, the imposing 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; Aasimar cleric, takes up half the table with his solemn presence. <strong>Dig</strong>, the towering bugbear with a coat of dark, streaked fur, hunches over, his monk habit hiding his appearance so that he doesn't unsettle the locals with his glowing, twitching eyes.</p>\n<p>Bellies full and information gathered, the party sets off to find <strong>Noomi&rsquo;s place</strong>, a lead Shannon&rsquo;s mother had cleverly left behind for them at the library. When they arrive, the sight hits them like a fist. The house is a disaster&mdash;a <strong>kitchen table hangs half out of a shattered window</strong>, the door is ripped from its hinges, and part of the roof looks like it caved in under something heavy. Whatever did this wasn&rsquo;t polite about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dig</strong>, ever the curious bugbear, steps inside first, his bulk almost too large for the doorway (or what&rsquo;s left of it). The floor is littered with <strong>copper plates</strong>, images of people engraved on them like tiny, forgotten memories. A <strong>woman who looks like a farmer</strong>, another <strong>figure in religious garb&mdash;one of the Clergy of Coia City, unmistakable in his old-fashioned robes</strong>. Another plate shows <strong>three figures&mdash;a male farmer, a large woman, and a young boy</strong>, larger than both, their expressions frozen in time.</p>\n<p>Then, the real find&mdash;<strong>Shannon&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s handkerchief</strong>, bloodstained. <strong>Tonks</strong> steps forward, eyes narrowing. With a flash of her magic, she traces the blood&rsquo;s memories, glimpsing through time. In her vision, she sees <strong>Shannon&rsquo;s mother</strong> and a <strong>young boy</strong>, almost certainly her brother, fighting off some creature. It&rsquo;s a blur of violence and screams.</p>\n<p>The house is silent now, but outside, <strong>wagon tracks</strong> lead into the hills. The party wastes no time, following the trail, eyes sharp, weapons at the ready.</p>\n<p>The tracks lead them through rough terrain, into a <strong>wide valley</strong>. On the far side, the land rises into <strong>rocky outcrops</strong>, jagged and sharp against the grey sky. Something moves on the ledge, a flicker of shadow. They barely have time to register the threat before the ground shakes, and a <strong>giant troll</strong> leaps from the mountain. It lands with a crash, sending <strong>rocks tumbling</strong>, burying <strong>half the party</strong> under rubble.</p>\n<p>And so, the fight begins. Tonks, ever quick on her feet, draws her bow with a practiced ease, arrows flying. <strong>Shannon</strong> dances around the troll&rsquo;s massive swipes, her dagger flashing in the dim light. <strong>Uriel</strong>, towering over the chaos, calls upon his divine power, light flaring around him as he moves in for the kill.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s <strong>Dig</strong>, the chaotic storm of a bugbear, who takes the battle to another level. His fur bristles with wild magic, casting strange shadows as he weaves in and out of the troll&rsquo;s reach, his claws leaving red-streaked gashes across the creature&rsquo;s hide.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, it&rsquo;s <strong>Uriel</strong> who finishes it. His <strong>mace</strong> comes down with a final, righteous blow, smashing into the troll&rsquo;s skull. The creature lets out a <strong>guttural, choking sigh</strong>, its massive body crumbling to the ground. The air fills with the stench of death and the acrid tang of old blood.</p>\n<p>For a moment, they think it&rsquo;s over. But then the sigh echoes off the cliffs, reverberating through the valley like some ancient signal. From the shadows, <strong>a colossal blue giant</strong> emerges, its eyes scanning the horizon, but mercifully, it doesn&rsquo;t see them.</p>\n<p>Yet.</p>",

But gold is gold, and we&rsquo;re adventurers, not accountants. As we're counting the coins, the Lord of Upper Lachus himself&mdash;an imposing man with a fine taste for grand gestures&mdash;offers a bounty we can't ignore: <strong>5000 gold per dragon slain</strong>, provided we bring back proof. The kind of offer that makes you sit up a little straighter.</p>\n<p>Oz is able to open the box we retrieved from the crypt to discover a <strong>Deck of Many Things</strong> inside. He starts to pull out a card&nbsp; out of curiosity but Harry and Uriel are able to stop him in time.</p>\n<p>But we&rsquo;ve got bigger fish to fry, at least for now. We explain that we&rsquo;re headed to Pony, and Ibrahim, ever the helpful one, suggests we skip the long, painful slog of walking and instead hop aboard a local <strong>airship</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Airship</strong>. Now that catches the ear.</p>\n<p>We make our way to <strong>Taylor&rsquo;s Bridge docks</strong>, where the ships hang in the air like giant, floating clouds tethered to the earth. There, we meet <strong>Amaretta Noctonic</strong>, the <strong>middle-aged gnome</strong> owner of the <strong>Azure Marie</strong>. Amerretta is a small woman with quick hands and quicker words, decked out in patchwork leather and with a perpetual squint like she&rsquo;s always scanning for the next storm on the horizon.</p>\n<p>A few exchanges of gold and pleasantries later, we&rsquo;re on board and lifting off, the ground falling away beneath us as the <strong>Azure Marie</strong> glides into the sky.</p>\n<p>Now, flying on an airship&mdash;it&rsquo;s something else. The wind howls past the deck, whipping at hair and cloaks, and the air smells fresher, almost <em>too</em> fresh, like a crisp winter morning before you get slapped with frostbite. For a few days, it&rsquo;s smooth sailing. The clouds roll past, the sun dips and rises, and it&rsquo;s almost peaceful. Almost.</p>\n<p>Of course, peace is a fleeting thing in our line of work. A few days into our voyage, <strong>Tonks</strong> is the first to spot it&mdash;a large shape in the distance, cutting through the clouds like a dagger. At first, it&rsquo;s hard to make out, but whatever it is, it&rsquo;s big, and it&rsquo;s coming straight for us.</p>\n<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it&mdash;just when things were getting cozy&mdash;a <strong>flock of harpies</strong> comes screeching out of the sky like a nightmare brought to life. Their <strong>wings beat</strong> the air in a frenzy, their <strong>piercing cries</strong> sending chills down our spines. The sound alone is enough to make your ears bleed, and that&rsquo;s before they start flinging themselves at the deck, claws out, eyes gleaming with bloodlust.</p>\n<p>Battle erupts. <strong>Shannon</strong>, quick as ever, darts across the deck, her <strong>dagger flashing</strong> as she slips between the harpies, cutting them down one by one. <strong>Tonks</strong>, with her bow at the ready, looses arrow after arrow, each shot finding its mark with a sickening thud. <strong>Uriel</strong>, towering over the chaos, swings his <strong>mace</strong>, crushing anything foolish enough to get close. And then there&rsquo;s <strong>Dig</strong>, his hulking frame tearing through harpy flesh like it&rsquo;s paper, his red-glowing hands crackling with wild magic as he channels chaos into each strike.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bloody, frantic affair, but when the last harpy falls from the sky, we stand victorious, the <strong>deck slick with blood and feathers</strong>, the wind carrying away the scent of death.</p>\n<p>But the threat&rsquo;s not over. That <strong>shape in the distance</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s getting closer now, and as the clouds part, we finally see it for what it is. A <strong>Roc</strong>, its wingspan larger than the ship itself, swoops down from the heavens. Its <strong>massive wings beat</strong> the air, sending gusts of wind that threaten to toss us overboard like leaves in a storm.</p>\n<p>For a tense moment, it feels like the Roc is about to snatch us right out of the sky&mdash;but then, with a flap of its titanic wings, it changes course, soaring past us with the grace of a creature that knows it could end us, but chooses not to. This time.</p>\n<p>The rest of the journey is quiet, but the tension lingers. We make it to <strong>Pony</strong>, our feet back on solid ground, but the sky has lost a little of its charm. There are worse things up there than clouds, and now we know.</p>",

Its wings stretch wide, its body an unholy vision of shimmering light and <em>wrath</em>, eyes burning with divine fury like it&rsquo;s got some unfinished business with the living. Spoiler: <em>We&rsquo;re the living.</em></p>\n<p>Before anyone can even blink, <strong>Dig</strong>&mdash;our walking mountain of fur and fists&mdash;charges straight at the thing. With a roar that echoes off the crypt walls, he <strong>punches</strong> the angel square in its face. But here's the kicker: The angel punches back. Hard. And down goes <strong>Dig</strong>, crumpling to the floor with a groan, as if trying to figure out what just hit him.</p>\n<p><strong>Oz</strong>, our trusty medic, doesn't waste a second. A quick flash of divine light later, and <strong>Dig&rsquo;s</strong> back on his feet, a little worse for wear but ready to jump back in the fray. Meanwhile, <strong>Tonks, Uriel, Harry, and Shannon</strong> are all over the angel, like wolves on a wounded deer. <strong>Shannon</strong> darts in and out, daggers flashing, while <strong>Harry</strong> unleashes arcane fire from the backline. <strong>Uriel</strong>, towering and unyielding, channels the wrath of his gods into each strike, his <strong>mace</strong> glowing with power.</p>\n<p>But this angel isn&rsquo;t going down without a fight. It charms<strong> Dig</strong>, twisting his mind until he&rsquo;s ready to turn on his own companions. But just as things look dicey, <strong>Oz</strong> steps up again, casting <strong>Calm Emotions</strong> like some serene, unbothered guardian, and brings <strong>Dig</strong> back from the brink.</p>\n<p><strong>Uriel</strong>, ever the reliable heavy hitter, ends it. With a mighty draw, he notches two arrows, lets them fly, and each one pierces the angel&rsquo;s chest with a satisfying, sickening <em>thunk</em>. The celestial creature shudders, its radiant light flickering out, and it collapses in a heap of glowing feathers and divine dust.</p>\n<p>We barely catch our breath before the <strong>crypt</strong> starts making noise. Something deep below, the kind of sound that crawls under your skin and makes your spine itch. We send <strong>Hedwig</strong>, <strong>Harry&rsquo;s owl familiar</strong>, to check it out. With a flash of <strong>Light</strong>, Hedwig swoops into the darkened crypt, his glowing form casting eerie shadows on the ancient stone walls.</p>\n<p>He finds it. A <strong>chamber</strong>, dark and dank, but that&rsquo;s not the worst of it. Inside, lurking in the corners like twisted guardians, are <strong>Not Beholders</strong>&mdash;yes, you heard that right. Not quite Beholders, but close enough to make you reconsider why we ever got out of bed that day.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ve got thralls, too&mdash;poor souls, peasants and farmers, their minds ripped apart and twisted to serve these horrors. But we don&rsquo;t give them the satisfaction of a long fight. It&rsquo;s brutal, it&rsquo;s quick, and it&rsquo;s messy. <strong>Tonks</strong>, ever the marksman, lets her arrows fly with pinpoint precision, and <strong>Shannon</strong> dances between enemies like a shadow with a blade. <strong>Uriel</strong> crushes anything that moves, and <strong>Dig</strong>... well, <strong>Dig</strong> is out for blood, his fists and wild magic tearing through the thralls and their masters with grim efficiency.</p>\n<p>When the last of the Not Beholders falls, we find a <strong>chest</strong>, half-buried in the rubble. It practically <strong>screams</strong> &ldquo;trap,&rdquo; but do we listen? Of course not. We pry it open, and it immediately <strong>explodes</strong>&mdash;right into <strong>Tonks&rsquo;s</strong> face. She takes it like a champ, though, wincing through the smoke and ash with that look that says, \"Of course it was trapped.\"</p>\n<p>The explosion aside, we <strong>do</strong> find some loot, but the real prize is this strange, intricate <strong>box with gears</strong>. Numbers line its surface, and it looks like it holds some kind of secret, but whatever it is, we&rsquo;ll need more than just brute force to figure it out.</p>\n<p>For now, we&rsquo;ve got the box, the crypt&rsquo;s quiet, and we&rsquo;re still breathing. Not a bad end to the day... all things considered.</p>",

Harry and Tonks are mesmerized by a skilled bard, and while under the influence of the melody, toss a few coins at him. Shannon, familiar with this trick, glances back and smirks, but says nothing.</p>\n<p>As the party reaches the Job Board off to one side of the Town Square Circle, the see several jobs posted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wanted: Red Cloak Thieves, 1g per cloak - report to Ali Jafar at the Citadel</li>\n<li>Dragon Slayer: several lower values crossed out, currently 500 platinum, the posting also contains a&nbsp;list of towns that have been destroyed - report to Ali Jafar at the Citadel&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Missing Boy: a drawing of a young man, about 15 years of age - report to Miss&nbsp;Lucille Honeychurch</li>\n<li>Investigate Cultists - report to Ali Jafar at the Citadel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The party decides to the Citadel to follow up on the job postings. Wehnt they arrive, the party is ushered in for an audience with the Lord of Upper Lachus, Ibrahim. <br><br>They first inquire about the Red Cloaks, making the connection between the bandits that attacked them on the road, who were wearing Red Cloaks. Ibrahim explains that the Red Cloaks are a thieves guild spread across Coia. They are primarily of concern here, and in Tetbury and Aveton as well. A standard reward is offered for their capture or death in attemtp to keep their numbers low and discourage recruits.</p>\n<p>The party asked several other questions related to their various tasks ahead, but did not recieve many answers. Ibrahim confirmed that the Dragon the party killed in Durmchapel was, in fact, the same Dragon that the city had posted a reward for; however, they had to verify the party's story with officials in Durmchapel to give the promise reward.<br><br>As the party turned to leave, Dig was a little too honest about their encounter with the Red Cloaks, while also providing too few details. As they turned to leave, Dig reminded Oz he had killed Miss Honeychurch's son, but neglected to mention that he was one of the bandits and a suspected Red Cloak. Unfortunately, Ibrahim immediately called the guards and would not listen to the party's explanation. Due to Ibrahim taking his shitty day out on whoever was convenient, the party was marched to jail cells beneath the Citadel.</p>\n<p>After much discussion, the party decided to wait until their story was confirmed. Knowing that everything they said would be verified, they harbored little doubt of being released, and eventually, rewarded. After many more hours of waiting than was promised, the guards return, and bring the party back to the Citadel's main hall. Ibrahim informs them that their story was confirmed by officials in Durmchapel, and returns their stuff. Since it is now late in the evening, Ibrahim asks to come back in the morning for their reward.</p>\n<p>Since the party spent the day resting, they decide to go investigate the cultists at the ruined chapel. After following the path described to them for several hours, they come upon the ruined chapel up on a hill. The party prepares an ambush, with Oz posing as a simple traveler. When the two figures sitting around a fire take notice, Oz quickly comes up with a story of a lost child in the woods and convinces one of them, named Paul, to come help in the search.</p>\n<p>As Oz leads Paul off into the woods, Dig assumes his form, and enters the church to get more information. With little resistance, he convinces the men inside to give him their weapons for 'cleaning'. Two of the men oblige, and Dig exits with weapons, tossing them aside in the woods.</p>\n<p>The second sentry, decides to check out the opposite side of the woods, and Tonk uses the distraction to confuse the man with a tree branch to the head. The party tries to get information from them, but can't determine if they are in fact, the cultists. Frustrated, the party goes into full attack mode, hoping that these are bad people. After several minutes of very one-sided battle, the party is able to dispatch all of the cult acolytes.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately, an evil spirit who seemed to be controlling the cult members did not like having thier thralls dispatched, and decided to take its frustration out on the party. At least now the party knows that these were in fact bad cultists, right?&nbsp;</p>",

Oz and Tarfon return, noting strange markings along the way which Tarfon points out as being part of his underground railroad.

It tries to fool them with duplicates of itself, but Uriel is undeceived and attacks the Phantasm.

He shocks the rope which is wet enough to carry current up to the Phantasm and bring it down.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Tonks skins the hide of the cloaker to make some armor. Shannon scoops up 2 vials of goop from the cockatrices. Having cleared the farm, they investigate the silo, to find strange carvings in the wood. A pair of diamonds is on an interior wall of the silo, and they find a trap door in the floor. Red leaps down to find a large domed room that looks like it could hold 100 people. He finds a scroll of invisibility and notices a carving of a T indicating a trolley stop.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">As half a dozen tielfling families begin to arrive from across the bridge, the group travels back to Beresko. After thanking Lord Arris for the orchard, they learn that Mayor Antoine Bernard of Durmchapel has asked for a large loan only a week ago. Ethos was not sure why, but they may be financial straights. Hoping this may be a possible lead, the group decides to travel there to assess the situation. Ethos gives them 3 greater healing potions and tells Tonks her 3 arrows are thunderclap arrows.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">After haggling for a horse and cart, we head out around lunchtime to begin the three-day journey to Durmchapel.

We let him know about the tielfings and our suggestion tha they hire them. He seems skeptical but confers with Arris. He notes that springtime might be a better time to bring them into town, but if they want a place for the winter, there&rsquo;s an abandoned orchard called Nadar&rsquo;s Apple Farm where they can stay. It&rsquo;s about a 2 hour walk outside the Field Gate and is marked by a large stone outcrop. He will have a guard show us the way.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Lady Nulura is waiting for Shannons and the guards escort Shannon and Oz to her chambers. Shannon is allowed in the room, but Oz is barred by the guards and forced to wait outside. Lady Noalara says she recognizes Shannon saying &ldquo;I think I know who you are and where you&rsquo;re from. You are among friend and family here.&rdquo; She lowers her cowl to reveal elf ears. She tells Shannon&nbsp; that 3 years ago her family traveled to Tetbury and she saw Shannon then along with her mother Lady Iriel Hargraven. She heard Mangdor Roth saying bad things about controlling the continent and building a stronger Coia. She remembers thinking that the ends didn&rsquo;t justify the means. Shannon reveals that her mother is from Whisperwood near Upper Lachas. Lady Nulura gives her a cloak and a book and wishes her well.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We meet up and the guard takes us out to the orchard. There are a few small gardens, a house and a farm, a wooden bridge, and two orchard fields. The guard tells us that something happened to the old couple who ran it a few months ago.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Oz, Shannon, and Tonks check out the house, While Uriel, Uba and Red checkout the garden.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Red looks over the garden gate to see what appear to be small filthy chickens running around. Uriel steps over the garden wall, and they immediately attack him. Recognizing them as cockatrice, Uriel is careful, but gets bitten by one and he starts to become petrified. Suddenly a bolt flies through the air and kills one of the cockatrice. Looking up, they see a red creature in the distance who must&rsquo;ve fired the arrow. Uba chomps the other cockatrice.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Scouting out the house, Shannon sees through the side window a large beast perched on top of the kitchen table. Firing a shot through the window, she hits it and it shoots through the roof. Oz fires on it and it disappears into smoke. Tonks cautiously enters the house only to find a second berbalang hiding in there. It also flies out and is killed by the group. Oz examines its body to find a platinum collar (worth 150 P) around its neck like it was a slave to something.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The red man from the woods comes forward and identifies himself as Tarfon the tiefling. Daerues had told him what happened and asked him to follow us. He tells us that this farm was part of an underground railroad for tieflings from long ago.

                    "session_report": '<p dir="ltr">We head back out onto the road and come upon a cart with some travelers who note that the road ahead is clear. Before sunset we come up to a huge tree that looks very out of place for the area. It&rsquo;s an ancient Goliath tree that offers the type of sturdy wood that old buildings still standing were made from. It appears to have a warding effect on the area as nothing bad seems to come near it. We grab some branches to craft arrows and wands from and spend the night.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The next morning we approach Berkeso. A large stone wall surrpounds the city but it looks like it has seen better days. The guard at the gate asks us our business and we replay that we&rsquo;re looking to sell some wares. He says his name is Methes Fusani and his brother Ethos Fusani is a guard for Lord Aaris.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We walk through town and notice more guards than we;d expect. We sell the wares we\'ve collected during our journey and decide to grab some lunch at the Laughing Eel. The barmaid Zathara Balthfensi takes our order and quickly serves us some food. We survey the place and notice a catwalk on the second floor where some scantily clad women are loitering. Quickly surmising that this may not be the most reputable place, we finish our meal and leave (but not before Uriel tries unsuccessfully to convince one to turn away from this sinful life).</p>\n<p dir="ltr">After lunch we approach the center castle to see Lord Aaris. There are few people in ine, in fact only one woman in her late thirties is ahead of us. As she is finishing up, a well-dressed woman and teenage boy enter the room and walk over to the lord. By their behavior we infer it to be his wife and son. The mother&rsquo;s gaze lingers on Shannon for a suspiciously long time befire they take their leave.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">When our turn arrives, we begin to tell him our tale but at the first mention of dragons, he waves us off to his advisor Ethos who tells us that our conversation would be better finished in a private chamber.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Heavy snow has begun to fall as we enter a well-upholstered back room. Ethos tells us that he&rsquo;s heard lots of stories about dragons of different colors, but none of them are from reliable sources so it&rsquo;s hard to put too much stock into them. They&rsquo;ve mostly been around the Cocker mountains in areas that had fallen on hard times with the regional lords. At the end of the last harvest all 3 lords raised taxes and the smaller villages couldn&rsquo;t adjust. He makes a comment that Arris &ldquo;will have to choose sides&rdquo; but then has to leave.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Left alone, we discuss the dragons. Uriel had heard of a dragon that was controlled once by a ranger and Red had also heard that there were ways to control dragons. Dragons normally just like to destory and hoard, but in the past theyve actually controlled people themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The guards let us know that recently many more guards had been conscripted to keep the rioters out and the city safe. Ethos returns to state that the weather is getting worse and we are welcome to stay the night and attend dinner as their guests. After freshening up, we attend dinner.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Oz attempts to woo a young brunette named Lexi. She&rsquo;s the daughter to Jankar and Yaldanna Ballal, two of the most influential people in the market. He peacocks, dances and does his best impression of John Travolta in Staylin Alive. He makes himself taller with some stilts from Red and entertains the entire crowd with a plate-smashing dance. She&rsquo;s suitably impressed and he gives her a sending stone.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Shannon and Tonks head toward the front to mingle with some of the upper-class people. They don&rsquo;t learn too much. Lady Nelora and Duke Arzeda make small talk and they notice Arzeda looking at Shannon and occasionally whispering something to his mother. Red sits with the poorer people while Uriel sits with the clergy and recognizes a friend Silas Swan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We learn that mostly people are pleased with how Lord Arris runs things, but some of the merchants feel things would improve if &ldquo;Lord Arris and the other big towns would take care of this threat&rdquo;. We also learn that recently someone came to Beresko from a town a few days away talking about how his town had recently been leveled but he wasn\'t sure if it was fire or lightning. After a few hours most everyone has retired and we follow suit.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Shortly before sun-up, the guards burst into the boys room. They need help outside of the MystGate, there are people out there hunting for food and threatening the city. They join the party so find that they can track footprints leading away but they disappear in a windswept area about 100 feet away. Calling the girls in for help, the entire group begins to track the group, traveling in the direction of Durmchapel. They are able to discern 4-5 sets of bipedal prints that Uba confirms don&rsquo;t smell like the people of beresko.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Just as Uba smells a campfire, an arrow comes out from up ahead and lodges in her upper shoulder. She lets out a howl of pain and we all take defensive stances. Shannon yells out that we come in peace but more arrows fly our way. Oz fires back in the general direction with a firebolt and we hear a cry as it hits.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Coming upon him, we find a old, wizened tiefling. We interrogate him to learn that his name is Dhaeris Balance and he and his family lived in a village that they had been ostracied from. While they&rsquo;d lived there peacefully for most of their lives, after the recent tax hikes and dragon attacks, their neighbors had turned on them for being tieflings. They were now foraging in the forest for food.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We suggest to them that Beresko needs guards and if they meet us outside the gates tomorrow at 10am, we&rsquo;ll put in a good word for them.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We return to the castle, but Dot follows Dhaeris back to his camp to spy.</p>',

Feeling lonely, Uriel summons a sprite called Uriah to accompany him as we set out for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We head back out to the main road and sometime after lunch Uba stops suddenly with her ears pointed back. She looks over towards the lake-side of the road, intent on something. Uriah goes invisible and checks it out, reporting back that there are two large creatures that look like big horse-sized chickens about 300 feet ahead. One of them is brown and walking around, the other is yellow and sitting in a nest. Something is sparking on the yellow one.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We approach cautiously and Tonks calls out to them, noting that we are friendly and mean them no harm. They tell us that they are chocobos and they have made a camp to hatch their eggs. They used to live on the northern side of Kilkburg Lake, but had recently been forced to move south due to disturbances.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Up a bit closer, we&rsquo;re able to see that it is a necklace hanging from the yellow chocobo\'s neck that was glistening. We offer to trade them food for the necklace and they accept. We shock some fish out of the water and quickly trap a few animals. We exchange them for the necklace and wish them luck. Uriel is able to identify it as the Necklace of Eiodlons and 3 of the 8 gems are still active.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We push on a bit more until rain starts to fall in the evening. We set up a make-shift camp for the night. The night starts uneventfully, but part way through the second watch, Uriel notices a dust cloud rising up and heading towards us.

As we approach the junction with Rigby&rsquo;s Road, we stop off and have a small lunch before heading back out, eager to make town by nightfall.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Arriving at Albrighing just after sunset, we find an eager stable-boy who stables our horses for the night and directs us to the local tavern for dinner. We meet the owner, a tall gnome named Daavis who introduces himself and eagerly regales us with stories about his town noting that it&rsquo;s only a few generations old. He tells us there hasn&rsquo;t been any recent trouble there, just that about five years ago a couple of ogres came through and caused a bother, but otherwise the town was a well-traveled enough place to be fairly safe.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Daavis tells us to see Annie next door about rooms for the night. We have a good rest and head out the next morning. As we travel south the winter winds pick up and it starts to become significantly colder. Oz notices Tonks shivering with exhaustion and he grabs some rocks and heats them up to create a traveling fireless fireplace to warm the group.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Our spirits refreshed, we continued on much the same as the day before, stopping only for a quick lunch.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Around nightfall, we enter an area where the trees have closed in toward the path and notice some movement in the treelines. Not looking for any trouble, we press the horses faster and sprint them through the area until we reach a clearer spot where the rock-face of the mountain would give us cover on one side.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The horses needed some rest and this looked a decent spot to setup camp. We kept the fireless fireplace going so as not to draw attention with an actual fire. Tonks offered to keep watch but Shannon told the group she had a magical bow that would alert them if anything dangerous approached. So they all tried to get some rest. Tonks and Shannon slept in the cart while Oz, Uriel, and Red snuggled underneath.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We rested for a few hours until Tonks and Shannon felt a buzzing sensation and bolted awake. Noticing several pairs of red eyes from about 60 feet away in the forest, they quietly alert the rest of the group that they are not alone. Oz attempts to command one of the creatures to approach but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand him. While the creature is distracted, Tonks mumbles something under her breath, cuts her own hand and wipes her bow with her own blood before firing off a couple well-placed arrows and killing it.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Uriel leaps out from under the cart and begins to disrobe. He puts his shield on his back and drops two long silver whips from each side.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>One in each hand, he stands at his full height and stares down the creatures. Shannon blushes at the display.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The creatures seem suitably scared and run around Uriel to attack the least threatening target Red. Out in the open, we&rsquo;re able to see that they look like emaciated dogs with wedge-shaped heads. There are three of them left and Red attempts to knock them back with a thunderwave before hightailing it to the other side of the cart.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Shannon and Tonks take out the second dog as the horses get startled and begin to rustle around, knocking both of them off their feet in the cart.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As Tonks tries rather unsuccessfully to calm the horses down, Uriel starts laying a smackdown on the other dogs. Oz kills the third with a firebolt and Red kills the fourth with a stone smash to the head.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Deciding it isn&rsquo;t safe to rest here any longer, we decide to push on slowly to take it easy on the horses and reach&nbsp;<a class="article-link article-explorer-link tooltipstered" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/maclif-settlement" data-article-privacy="public" data-article-id="970b0649-80ba-4d80-a190-b38ce82329f0" data-template-type="settlement" data-article="970b0649-80ba-4d80-a190-b38ce82329f0">Maclif</a><a class=" world-editor-link" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/world/settlement/970b0649-80ba-4d80-a190-b38ce82329f0/edit">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;just after the break of dawn.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>We see the remains of a small village that appears to have been home to some simple hunters and trappers. There&rsquo;s a mountain river that flows down into a pond nearby that drains underground. As we walk around the remains of the singed town, we see that it appears to have been destroyed not in a long blast of flame, but in arcs of destruction that look like acid burns. This ties in with Tonks\' belief that it&rsquo;s the work of a black dragon who blasts not fire, but acid.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Curiously, some of the roofs appear to have been torn open and inside those buildings are severe acid burns, almost like the dragon had looked inside of them for something.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As this was a small simple town where the people were already unable to pay their taxes, we theorize that maybe something was commanding the dragon to look for something, rather than a dragon on its own looking for treasure.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Finding little else in the way of clues, we decide to head down to the nearby town of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/coia-pcollette/a/somania-settlement">Somania</a><a class=" world-editor-link" href="https://www.worldanvil.com/world/settlement/99489b53-5a44-4c9c-bb22-4b4afb63a131/edit">&nbsp;</a>.

The townspeople were decimated, sorrowsworn and ghouls roamed the streets and there was even a large dinosaur that was seen roaming about.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Since then, the remaining townsfolk had been gradually trying to rebuild and get Herthe back to its former glory. Unfortunately they still didn&rsquo;t have a miller and that was making it hard to draw people in. His father Wolfgang had been acting as a de-facto mayor of the town. Since there were less people, the wildlife had become emboldened, often stealing supplies and killing livestock. When it was reported that some wolves had been seen sneaking around the old game trails behind the meadery, Wolfgang and the young butcher Marcus had decided to head off into the woods and to try to trap them.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Arnold is almost in tears as he tells them his story.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The group around the bar decide to take action. As Oz accompanies Shannon back to her house to get changed and drop off supplies to her librarian roomate, the rest of the group chat more with Arnold and others in the tavern. Rabbard Crancher, his wife Lily and their nephew&nbsp;<strong class="article-unlinked">Samuel</strong>&nbsp;are eating dinner at a nearby table. Rabbard tells them he&rsquo;s seen at least 2 wolves himself behind the meadery and rumor has it that there are creatures even bigger than a wolf around also. Oz and Shannon return and the group head out.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Tonks leads the way as they head north of the meadery, tracking up to the base of a hill with a clearing ahead. The animal tracks are abundant but no human prints are on the ground. At the edge of the clearing she can make out drag marks that look recent. They notice movement to the left.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>Fearing what may lie ahead she reaches into a small rust-colored pouch from her hip, pulls out a furry little ball and throws it onto the ground. The entire group goes wide-eyed as the tiny fur ball grows into a large brown bear.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She commands the bear to scout out to the movement on the left, and it reports back that there are two wolves near a cave. Oz quickly sends a fireball their way. It misses them but scares them to run back into the cave.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>The group quickly dispatch the wolves, but then hear a cry from deeper inside the cave &ldquo;Help us! There&rsquo;s two more!&rdquo; Entering the cave further, they are set upon by a large Warg and a Dire Wolf. Another missed fireball lights up the back of the cave where they see Wolfgang and Marcus hiding out on a rock platform, high enough to be out of reach, but looking pretty weak and hungry.<span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They clear out the cave and rescue Wolfgang and Marcus who tell them they had discovered the cave and were already inside when the wolves came back and trapped them there. They notice in the far side of the cave is a simple cave drawing on the wall of a family, a boy, and a bear. Underneath the bear is written a single word: &ldquo;<strong>Honeybear</strong>&rdquo;.</div>',
